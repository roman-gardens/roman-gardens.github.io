Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.
Location Sufetula
Sufetula (Pleiades)
Location Description Sufetula founded under Vespasian was a center of oil production. Excavations have shown that the city was laid out on a grid plan that was not strictly followed. Numerous buildings have been uncovered among them the forum, the capitol, the triumphal gateway dedicated to Antonius Pius, a triumphal arc of the Tetrarchy, the Great baths, the theater and the episcopal group that comprised two large basilicas called Vitalis and Bellator, which are separated from each other by the Jucundus Chapel. Annexes, among them, small baths and probably the dwellings of the clergy, surround this complex.
