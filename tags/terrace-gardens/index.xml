Sublocation Sperlonga
Sublocation Description Sperlonga is a maritime villa built at the end of the Roman Republic. It probably belonged to some very rich piscinarius, one of those extremely wealthy Roman patricians who took delight in creating their own fish ponds. The purpose might have been to always find fresh fish at their disposal, or, at least, so they said. Actually those Tritones piscinarum, as Cicero called them (CIC. Att. 2.1.6; 2.9.1), considered their piscinae more a status symbol than an industrial operation, and cherished their fishes more as pets than as tasty tidbits (VARR. r. r. 3.17.3). Sperlonga, with its lavish decoration and its luxurious setting, was built by one of these tycoons. Built, yes, but by whom? When, in the middle of the last century, this villa was discovered, some scholars decided that it must have been Tiberius. Actually the only connection we could establish between the ancient emperor and this place is the fact that he nearly died while dining in the villa&amp;rsquo;s colossal nymphaeum. At this time he was traveling from Capri to Rome and stopped at Sperlonga to rest. We read that he was there, on a small island set at the center of the fishpond, laying with his friends on mattresses placed around an elegant water triclinium (Fig. 91, A) set on a small island at the center of the fishpond. They were drinking, chatting and enjoying the splendid view of the statuary groups displayed in the nymphaeum when the entrance of the grotto crashed down in a historical landslide reported by both Suetonius (Tib. 39) and Tacitus (ann. 4.59) (Fig. 92). I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine how this unfortunate dinner could place Tiberius as the owner and the creator of the spectacular grotto. However this is what some scholars assert and they still believe it. I can&amp;rsquo;t agree. For one thing we know that Tiberius disapproved of luxury. In Tacitus (TACITUS) we find the transcription of some of his speeches to the senate and we notice how harshly he attacked all the people who built luxurious villas and bought expensive statues to put in them. How could Tiberius censor his fellows countrymen for purchasing some marble copies of goddesses and heroes, while he himself was importing from Greece those monumental Hellenistic groups, and setting them in the seaside grotto of a more than sumptuous maritime residence? It was not logical, and for this reason we feel quite certain that Tiberius had no part in creating the Sperlongan art display. However, are we sure that the villa didn&amp;rsquo;t belong to the imperial praedia? No, we can&amp;rsquo;t even deny this: Sperlonga could have entered Augustus' estate through a legacy. As a matter of fact we know that, on their death, many rich men used to leave their property to the emperor. Some of these tycoons and also some relatives of the Julio-Claudian family could easily have done this. We can&amp;rsquo;t even forget that - as reported by Cicero (CIC. I cent. B.C.) - Philip, Augustus' stepfather, was one of the most important and rich piscinarii of the I cent B.C. Apart from this we can&amp;rsquo;t say anything more.
Garden The villa has three gardens: one peristyle garden, one cryptoporticus and the terrace on the sea, one nymphaeum.
Keywords villa courtyards terrace gardens Garden Description These parts of the villa have been relatively spared and they are among the best features of this maritime residence (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2002). As a matter of fact, also when the peristyle garden was flourishing, it could never have been as impressive as this imposing cryptoporticus and its underlying terrace (Fig. 93, B), beautiful places to stroll and admire the glorious sunset. The combination of a cryptoporticus and a terrace to create a new kind of garden, was already present in Roman architecture. We can see it depicted in the Pompeian frescoes and we find it in other seaside villas. For instance this kind of open-air arrangement was extensively described in a letter in which Pliny the Younger pointed out the highlights of his cherished Laurentine villa to one of his friend (PLIN. epist. 2.17). In Sperlonga as in Pliny&amp;rsquo;s terrace, a narrow border of flowering plants was set against a low masonry wall, a parapet which was necessary to protect the vegetation from the salty sea breezes (Fig. 94). Today, the fact that bunches of blossoms existed there is confirmed by the presence of a watering system which started from some spring set high on the overhanging hill. We can follow the trace of a groove cut in the rock coming down to the fishpond&amp;rsquo;s northeastern bank. From the piscina side, through a canal (Figs. 91, S; 96), the water was led up to the low parapet of the terrace (Fig. 97), and here, turning at a right angle, it ran all along it. At regular intervals, a series of drain wells helped to draw the water and irrigate the plants. Their presence confirm that a flowerbed existed there and that it was set against the wall.

The house of this villa rustica of the 2nd century is of the winged corridor type with two protruding wings framing a large courtyard in front of the house at the south (Fig. 1).
The courtyard was divided into two zones by a terrace(?) wall, and in both zones a garden has been reconstructed (G in Fig. 1). Entering the house from the south, one passed through a large reception room to an apsed triclinium with hypocaust heating. A bath complex lay to the southwest, entered by the portico next to the garden.

insulae peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes terrace gardens Garden Description This house, built on sloping terrain on the northern edge of the city around AD 150, was enlarged twenty years later to incorporate at least two certain gardens (Fig. 1). It bordered north and south on streets and was flanked on the east and west by other houses. In this last phase after ca. 170, the house covered an area of about 2000 square meters. In the center of the building was an irregular peristyle courtyard, at the north end of which was a private bath complex.
East of the house was a long rectangular area open to the sky and divided into plots by a wall. In the northernmost plot a layer of humic soil 20-40 centimeters thick was excavated that the excavators interpret as evidence for a garden (G on plan).
The northern part of the house facing the street included an open terrace which may have been built up on demolished walls of the earlier house. Humus-rich soil in the terrace area may indicate that it was planted (G in Fig. 1). Immediately south of the terrace was a portico that offered a splendid view of the valley.

From the north and south corners of the house, walls ran in a westerly direction to enclose an open courtyard (G in Fig. 1) approximately 65 meters wide and 45 meters deep from the outer boundary to the main entrance of the house. A paved path was axially arranged in the courtyard to connect the entrance to the courtyard with that of the residential building. The western third of the courtyard is marked off by low scarps which may be remains of garden terraces (T in Fig. 1). Finds from the site indicate a 3rd/4th century date for the complex.
