Sublocation Region I
Insula Insula V
Keywords peristyle porticoes triclinium Garden Officina Coriariorum of M. Vesonius Primus (tannery) with a peristyle garden and large open space to the rear.
Garden Description A. This tannery was excavated in 1873-1874. The peristyle courtyard had a portico to the north and east supported by brick pillars which had been most likely been built when the original house was converted to a tannery. Against the west wall there was a masonry triclinium (l. medius 4.99m; l. summus and l. imus 4.96m; table, 1.78 x 0.93m). The top of the triclinium table held the famous mosaic of a skull 0.45 x 0.50m (Mus. Naz. inv. no. 109 982; Reusch no. 163). Here a mosaic representing the Epicurian philosophy and featuring a large skull over a butterfly on a wheel, indicative of the soul and time, was found here. On either side of the skull are the possessions of both the rich and poor with a plumb line hanging over the skull indicating the equalizing power of death. The northeastern part of the courtyard was a rectangle, the north side of which was formed by the three first intercolumniations counting from the northeast corner of the north portico, and the east side by the first two intercolumniations counting from the same corner. This area was paved with opus signinum. The little area around the triclinium between the paved area and the west wall was believed to be a garden according to Mau.
B. The south half of the insula was also excavated in 1873-74. It was accessed from the back door in the peristyle garden of the tannery by descending six steps. This was a large open area that had been cleared of previous structures. Formerly there had been five doors in the south wall leading to the pomerium but these were closed up. This area could have been used as a kitchen garden as suggested by Tatiana Warscher or for drying leather as suggested by Viola.
