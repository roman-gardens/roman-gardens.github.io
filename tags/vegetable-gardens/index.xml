Keywords vegetable gardens Garden Description Jashemski examined this sizeable garden to the rear of this property in 1957 and concluded that the pronounced north-south furrows bordered by water channels indicated that this was most likely a vegetable garden. An oven against the south wall of the entrance room, and a bowl in the garden, suggest this was a caupona. The oven sat in an arch below a set of stairs which lead from the garden to an upper floor.
