Keywords aedicula amphorae atrium caupona flowerpots lararium portico triclinium Garden Garden serving a caupona.
Garden Description The garden east of the atrium had a portico extending along the south and part of the west sides. A low wall (0.52m high) connected the columns and an entrance to the garden was located on the west. In 1873 the caupona was excavated. The garden contained a masonry triclinium (l. medius, 3.85m; l. summus and l. imus, 3.20m) with a table. The badly damaged triclinium revealed the amphorae used in its construction. A low podium along the north wall was thought by Fiorelli to have held flowerpots. Mau reported a drainage channel at the corner of the triclinium formed by the l. meduis and the l. summus, although it is no longer evident. The base of an aedicula lararium remains against the east wall opposite the north end of the east couch.

Garden Description This caupona was excavated in 1873 but the reports offer insufficient details to determine if the open area had been planted. The room was entered directly from the street and the open area, had a portico on the north and east supported by one pillar. Fifteen amphorae with inscriptions were uncovered here.

Garden Description This small caupona had a garden at the rear with a roofed passageway on the east and the south. It was excavated in 1873 and a masonry biclinium (l. medius, 2.65m.; l. imus 2.94 m.) with a round table (dia. 0.93 m.) was uncovered in the northwest corner and a niche lararium on the north garden wall.

Keywords tabernae amphorae (storage vessels) triclinium table dolium courtyard aedicula gutter stucco hearth Garden Vineyard with large masonry triclinium, treading floor and courtyard garden.
Garden Description A. The access to this garden featured an arched niche high on the garden wall located either side of the direct entrance from the street at entrance 8. A further entrance (7A) from the street was located on the east wall. The masonry triclinium (l. medius, 3.60 m.; l. imus 3.20 l. summus 2.43 m.) in the northwest corner had a round table (0.55 m. in dia.) between the couches and a rectangular table (0.65 x 1.03 m.) built against the north wall. A cistern opening was found to the south of the triclinium. To the left of entrance 8, a small room was excavated in 1985 to reveal a treading floor that allowed the juice from the grapes to flow into a small dolium. This indicates that the garden was most likely planted in vines.
B. Entrance 8 opened directly into a courtyard garden. A cistern opening in the northeast corner of the garden was fed by a gutter along the east edge. To the right of the door on the east wall was a small niche lararium with an aedicula façade. To the right of this niche, a painting of Hercules was displayed in a red border. Below this was a garden setting with an altar and a crested serpent painted in low stucco relief. In the interior area of this property, stairs leading to an upper floor and a hearth in a kitchen area were located. The stairs likely led to accommodation.

Garden Description The garden in the southeast section of this area was shared the house at entrance 3 and shops 4, 5, and 6 on the Via dell’Abbondanza. It was also possible to enter the garden from the side street at entrance 7. Jashemski established in 1975 that the area had been planted due to the presence of scattered root cavities, but extensive damage to the soil prevented the recovery of an accurate planting plan.

Keywords vegetable gardens Garden Description Jashemski examined this sizeable garden to the rear of this property in 1957 and concluded that the pronounced north-south furrows bordered by water channels indicated that this was most likely a vegetable garden. An oven against the south wall of the entrance room, and a bowl in the garden, suggest this was a caupona. The oven sat in an arch below a set of stairs which lead from the garden to an upper floor.

Keywords atrium caupona tabernae triclinia Garden Description A. A very small bath was located at the left rear of the atrium in this unusual building. Behind this was a tiny garden with three small triclinia on either side. The couches of these six triclinia were so low and narrow they must have been used as seats similar to the tabernae attached to the house of Julia Felix (II.iv.7). B. Another small garden was found to the rear of the caupona.
