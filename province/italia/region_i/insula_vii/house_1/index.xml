Keywords archaeological garden basins (vessels) columns (architectural elements) gutters (building drainage components) loggias oeci pergolas peristyles (columnades) piscinae porticoes puteal tablina triclinia Garden Description This elegant house was excavated in 1923. To the rear was a large and sunny peristyle garden (a) with a portico on four sides supported by sixteen columns. At the northeast corner stood a lava puteal with a gutter that ran around the edges of the garden. In the center of the garden a wooden triclinium was shaded by a pergola supported by four columns. The nails and the imprint of the wooden structure of the triclinium were clearly preserved. A marble faced rectangular pool, with an apse-shaped extension to the north and a fountain jet, was located in front of the triclinium. Fig. 3, Fig. 4. This pool was connected to a smaller marble basin between the couches of the triclinium. An excellent view of the garden was afforded from the large salon (b) at the rear of the tablinum with two columns at the entrance of the portico. The oecus (c) also opened on the north portico with a fine view of the garden and the loggia above had a view of the garden as well as views to the sea and the Lattari Mountains. Fig. 5.
