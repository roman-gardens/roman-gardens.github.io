Keywords aedicules archaeological garden atriums cisterns (plumbing components) columns (architectural elements) engaged columns lararia peristyles (columnades) porticoes puteal tables (support furniture) triclinia Garden Description One step above the level of the triclinium of this small house with an irregular floor plan was a peristyle garden (a). It was to the west of the atrium and enclosed on the north and east by a portico. Fig. 3. Five columns supported the portico and two engaged columns on the west wall continued the order of the peristyle. A large tree root cavity (the cast measures 0.80 x0.82) indicated that the garden was well shaded and nail holes in the wall would suggest that vines had been trained to grow in that area. A large window located in the room to the west (b) gave a view into the garden. A puteal was located over the cistern opening in the northwest corner of the peristyle and another puteal was additionally found in the garden as well as a cartibulum (table) decorated on one side with lions heads and a small circular base most likely used for a statuette. A lararium on the west wall consisted of an aedicula façade with an arched niche. Fig. 4, Fig. 5.
