Africa proconsularis (Pleiades)
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.

Plan of City Plan of the Thugga Location Description Annexed in 46 B.C., the Romanization of the city of Thugga that was probably a residence of the Numidian kings, was gradual but profound. It became Municipium Thuggense in 205, and was raised to the rank of a Colonia Licinia Septima Aurelia Alexandriana Thuggensesin in 261 under Gallien. Numerous buildings of this city overlooking the valley of the Ouadi Khaled, have been uncovered among them the Capitol dedicated to the Capitoline Triad in 166-67, the theater on the top of the plateau constructed under Antonius Pius, the Temple of Mercury, Fortune, Augustan Piety, Liber Pater, Concordia, Frugifer, Pluto, Saturn and the Temple of Caelestis which stands in the middle of a an olive grove. In the residential areas stands the Licinian Baths with their Palestrae and the Cyclops Baths and the Triumphal Arch of Septimus Severus set astride a street leading down the hill. Two building inscriptions (CIL VIII, 26606 and CIL VIII, 26607), dated to AD 166-169 mention a theater with a basilica, porticoes, and xystis.
Garden Sanctuary B, the templa Concordiae
Keywords xystis Garden Description The anonymous sanctuary, called Dar Lachheb (184-187 CE), located about fifty meters below the forum, is of African type. In line with the entrance to the complex, a large cella with an apse opens onto the northern gallery of the triplex porticus that frames the courtyard. The courtyard consists of four symmetrical, rectangular spaces of equal dimensions, probably planted and enclosed by solid stone balustrades. The enclosure of areas of greenery in the worship space is similar to the sanctuary of Minerva 2

Garden Sanctuary B, the templa Concordiae
Keywords xystis Garden Description Sanctuary B, the templa Concordiae (117-138 CE), is a monument from the time of Hadrian dedicated to several deities, four of whom are known from the texts: Concordia, Frugifer, Liber Pater and Neptune (Figure 7). The complex is distinguished from the other cult complexes of the city by the integration of a sacred theater. The sanctuary comprises a courtyard surrounded by a quadriportico on which five cellae opened to the northwest. The largest and most elaborate, that dedicated to Concord, is located on the axis of the building and its extension in the theater below. This axiality is expressed by a central aisle that leads from the western portico to the altar located in the center of the courtyard. The area was not paved; one can imagine that it was planted as a garden whose vegetation formed a green setting around the altar.

Garden The sanctuary of Minerva 2
Keywords xystis Garden Description The sanctuary of Minerva 2, (138-161 CE), built later than the templa Concordiae, presents a very different configuration. The cella, projecting outwards from the courtyard lined with porticoes, is built on a very high podium whose summit corresponded to the level of the peribolus roof and to which access was gained by a monumental staircase. The temple, by its insertion in the topography of the site, seems to emerge from the cliff into which it was embedded. The approach was a long allée bordered on both sides by planting beds that emphasized the perspective centered on the cella. An open-air ambulatio, bordered by a balustrade, ran alongside the porticoes and the staircase, restricting access into the planted areas. Located on the outskirts of the city, one can imagine that the temple nestled in the cliff, perhaps surrounded by trees. The vegetation thus embraced the sanctuary as a whole and framed the altar located on the axial path leading to the temple.

Garden The sanctuary of the Victories of Caracalla
Keywords xystis Garden Description The sanctuary of the Victories of Caracalla, situated in the southwest of the forum, was built in a residential area in 214 CE on a particularly cramped and steep site (figure 12). Its urban and topographical situation conditioned its architecture. It is accessed by a lateral staircase, built onto bedrock, which leads to a courtyard, without a portico due to the lack of space. Its layout is similar to that of the sanctuaries of Minerva 2 and Dar Lachheb, with the cross-shaped layout of the paths that delimit four quadrangular spaces, probably planted, located at each corner of the courtyard, and bordered by solid balustrades, also in stone. A staircase of nine steps leads to the tetrastyle temple in antis and pseudo-peripteral which occupies the full width of the sanctuary. This example attests to the desire to introduce vegetation when space was lacking; could this be an indication of the role given to plants in certain cult spaces?
