Keywords fauces tondi peltae pinakes impluvia Garden Description A. The excavation of this house in 1934-1936 revealed an unusual atrium arrangement, which Maiuri states is the first time the architectural scheme that is used in a peristyle was stylishly applied to the atrium. The atrium had no fauces, there were three columns on both the north and south sides, and on the west side there were two engaged columns with two freestanding columns between them forming the entrance and supporting the room above. A collection of marble oscilla was uncovered here, second only to the collection found in the House of the Golden Cupids in Pompeii. The tondi, peltae, and pinakes were hung between the columns against the background of glossy red walls. Various Dionysiac and theater themes, satyrs, maenads, Pan, theater masks, an amorino, a sea horse and a sea panther were the subjects featured on the oscilla. The impluvium was enclosed by a low wall with a planting space on the top providing a garden atmosphere to the atrium. A marble puteal was located on the west side of the impluvium.

Keywords fauces aedicula opus signinum aedicula lararium [lararium] Garden Description 549.V.5. Visible from the fauces, this little courtyard (a) had an elaborate aedicula shrine which was excavated in 1932-1933. A low double wall with a gutter bordered the courtyard on the west and north sides with a cistern opening located in the center of the west edge of garden. Four small flower beds on the sides and a circular bed in the center had raised borders to retain the water for the plants within, and the remainder of the courtyard was paved in opus signinum. Jashemski commented that the garden had been restored with eleven such small planting beds. The east wall had traces of an animal painting on a blue background by the aedicula lararium. A deer was painted on the right side and several more indistinct animal forms were noted over the lararium. At the south end of this wall there were traces of leaves and a lattice fence suggesting a garden painting may have been located here.
