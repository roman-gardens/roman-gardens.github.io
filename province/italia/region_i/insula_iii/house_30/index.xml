Keywords amorini archaeological garden bas-reliefs (sculpture) busts (sculpture) lararia peristyles (columnades) porticoes Garden Description This small house, excavated in 1872, had no atrium and the peristyle garden (a) was to the right of the north end of the entrance passageway. A portico enclosed the garden on the west, north, and part of the south sides. Part of the portico had been closed to make rooms. Paintings of amorini decorated the peristyle with two little busts that may have been portraits of the owners. A lararium painting and an arched niche were located in the west wall of the peristyle. A small marble column with bas-relief of foliage most likely served as garden decoration.
