From the CMS: 14: Notes and Bibliography 14.206: Titles for websites, blogs, and social media Chapter Contents / Websites, Blogs, and Social Media
Titles of websites are generally set in roman without quotation marks and capitalized headline-style. In a departure from the recommendations in the previous edition, the title of a website that is analogous to a traditionally printed work but does not have (and never had) a printed counterpart can be treated like the titles of other websites, subject to editorial discretion. For example, Wikipedia can be treated as a website rather than as a conventional encyclopedia, with roman rather than italics for the title. (When in doubt, opt for roman.) Titled sections or pages of a website are usually placed in quotation marks. The titles of blogs—like those of journals and other periodicals—can usually be set in italics; titles of blog posts (analogous to articles in a periodical) are placed in quotation marks. (The distinction between a blog and a website is often unclear; when in doubt, treat the title like that of a website.) Many websites do not have titles per se; these can be identified in terms of the entity responsible for the site (and cited accordingly). For additional examples, see 8.191–92.

Whether created by highly skilled topiarii such as the freedman Tiberius Claudius Turiscus in Rome, by an anonymous team of gardeners and trainees at a tomb in Andematunum, Germania, or by a shopkeeper in Pompeii, gardens have left material traces discoverable from archaeological digs, in literature, paintings, inscriptions, or coins.
We present this evidence for the garden culture of the Roman Empire in a searchable encyclopedic format. Scholars, students, and the interested public internationally can explore a wide array of topics to address contemporary questions about imperial power, daily life, the environment, garden art, and religion across the diverse cultures of the Roman world.
Beta! We are launching the GRE website in a beta format. As a legacy project, our goal is to share the original text prepared by Wilhelmina Jashemski and her editorial team, and develop this site in collaboration with our readers. We invite you to test out the entries and join us to make this a great resource in content and function! Between now and August we will be rolling out all of the original material. We will also be seeking new garden entries. To give feedback, submit an entry, or join us, visit the contribute page.

It has engaged an interdisciplinary team of nearly 200 scholars, students, volunteers, and specialists to assemble a vast body of data into this digital project, which complements, but is independent of, a print volume of essays published by Cambridge University press. Ultimately, this website is designed to publish the assembled catalogue of material in the format in which Jashemski first envisioned it, while using contemporary digital tools to make the data readily navigable. It takes the project forward into the future with essential search tools, links, and maps. The result is a website that realizes her original vision while transforming the project into a fully independent digital forum for research on Roman gardens and designed landscapes.
Origins The seeds of this project were sown in 1955, when Wilhelmina Jashemski set out to record all of the known gardens of the Roman Empire. That year she traveled with husband Stanley Jashemski throughout the Mediterranean and ended with a single day at Pompeii, as she believed the gardens preserved by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius were already documented and published. It was their first visit overseas and they were not able to find many actual gardens, but Prof. Jashemski built a critical network of scholars. Stanley Jashemski recorded the sites on Kodachrome film, which had recently been marketed for use by educators. This was the beginning of an invaluable record he created of archaeological sites.
During their long trip to Europe in 1959, they spent some weeks in Greece. They saw the gardens excavated by Dorothy Burr Thompson at the Temple of Hephaistos in Athens, but few other ancient garden sites. Rather, this trip allowed Wilhelmina, the daughter of Nebraska farmers, to observe horticultural methods, talk with farmers and gardeners, learn Mediterranean plants and the agricultural calendar, as well as to work with her husband to create a photographic record, later published as Wildflowers amidst the Ruins and as the plants catalogue of the Natural History of Pompeii.
This trip terminated at Pompeii. The expert on Pompeiian gardens at that time, Tatiana Warscher, convinced the Jashemskis of the need to create a record of Vesuvian gardens. Mme. Warscher passed on her extensive knowledge of the region’s gardens, and they continued to correspond until her death in 1961. The Jashemskis spent the next twenty five years recording and excavating the gardens of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Oplontis and the other villages, villas, and farms of the area, recording 646 gardens and 202 garden paintings for her two volume work, The Gardens of Pompeii (1979, 1993). She carried out this work with Stanley Jashemski, who built up his camera equipment, recorded fading wall paintings as well as gardens, drew the plans, and advised on scientific techniques until his death in 1981.
Collaborative Approach to Gardens of the Roman Empire In 1979, Wilhelmina Jashemski retired from the University of Maryland. This year was marked by the publication of the Gardens of Pompeii, as well as the spring symposium at Dumbarton Oaks, Ancient Roman Gardens, co-hosted with Landscape Studies Director, Elisabeth Blair MacDougall. The papers included reports by Alarcao on the gardens at Conimbriga, Portugal, by Barry Cunnliffe on Fishbourne Roman Villa, Marcel Le Glay on the gardens of Vienne, and her own work in Campania. This symposium brought together, for the first time, many archaeologists—and students—working on Roman gardens. Jashemski credits the conference with shaping the collaborative format of Gardens of the Roman Empire. A second symposium, Ancient Roman Villa Gardens, added new discoveries from Italy (Eugenia Salza Prina Ricotti and Walter Widrig), the Vesuvian region (Stefano de Caro and Wilhelmina Jashemski), and Montmaurin, Gaul (Jean-Marie Pailler). During the 1980s, Jashemski sought to advance garden archaeology in Europe through her participation in Dumbarton Oaks events and an extensive program of lectures. Classical archaeologists began to explore areas outside building walls and to share their results with Jashemski. She was in much demand. After work at Pompeii, she undertook excavations at Hadrian’s Villa with Eugenia Salza Prina Ricotti and at Thuburbo Majus with Margaret Alexander. A student of Barry Cunliffe’s, Kathryn Gleason responded to a request from Ehud Netzer to examine the gardens of Herod the Great’s palaces at Judea. She began to develop methods of environmental archaeology to recover evidence of gardens outside the fine preservation conditions of the Vesuvian region.
In 1988, having completed the manuscripts Gardens of Pompeii vol. 2, and the Natural History of Pompeii, she returned to the idea of Gardens of the Roman Empire. She created an international team of archaeologists to serve as area editors of the different provinces of the Empire at its fullest extent under Trajan. They were charged with seeking out and assembling all known Roman gardens into a consistent catalogue style format. This would be paired with a volume of essays, to be published by Cambridge University Press. Some editors wrote up all the entries, while others had garden archaeologists author their own entries. In 1995, Jashemski, together with Kathryn Gleason, area editor for the provinces of the Levant and Asia Minor, hosted a conference at the University of Pennsylvania Museum. The unexpected extent of preserved Roman garden culture astounded everyone and it was clear that much work lay ahead.
By 2005, the compendium of garden sites approached one thousand, including those of the Vesuvian region. The manuscript exceeded the word count allowable for a print volume. Jashemski worked with the area editors to cut their text back to one or two paragraphs. She wrote an abridged version of the Gardens of Pompeii that forms the basis for the entries on this website. Meanwhile, Amina-Aicha Malek, as a fellow at Dumbarton Oaks, assisted Jashemski to contact scholars. New discoveries continued to arrive. Cambridge recommended that the catalogue material be placed in a CD of the catalogue to be inserted in the back of the book to allow full entries with color images. Jashemski was also very pleased that readers would be able to navigate the catalogue on screen while reading the book of essays. Clopper Almon scanned the illustrations and explored alternative formats to expedite the project. Meanwhile, Gleason, Malek and Hartswick focused their attention on assisting Jashemski with the essay volume. This was the state of the project at the time of her death on Dec. 24, 2007. Her executor, Henry Ferry, appointed Kathryn Gleason as executive editor of the project, with Kim Hartswick and Amina-Aicha Malek as co-editors. Michele Palmer took on the role of project manager and Victoria I provided advice on graphic layout. Gleason’s students at Cornell University scanned slides, prepared maps and reconstruction drawings. Working with Beatrice Rehl of Cambridge University Press, the team explored the emerging options for digital publication, as they worked to get the essay volume through press.
By the time the print volume was published, most options for the huge catalogue had proved unworkable due to cost, technical demands, and/or archival stability. Gleason and her students worked with Keith Jenkins of Mann Library at Cornell to create an effective GIS map for navigation, but the text based presentation remained to be designed. Area editor Roger Bagnall proposed having the ISAW digital humanities team create a prototype with blog technology that was inexpensive and archivally stable. Led by Head Librarian David Ratzan and post-doctoral fellow Christian Casey, they designed a prototype that was inexpensive, archivally stable, and relatively simple to build and maintain using readily available blog software. Confined by the COVID pandemic in 2020, ISAW interns, Cornell students, and an international group of volunteers have digitized the manuscript for the Gardens of the Roman Empire, bringing it into the future.</description></item><item><title>Contribute</title><link>https://roman-gardens.github.io/contribute/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Apr 2021 12:25:51 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://roman-gardens.github.io/contribute/</guid><description>Content Corrections/Errors Please sent an email with the url link to: Jane Millar Problems with navigation and links: Christian?

The entries range from sites that have been excavated using contemporary techniques to early sites where gardens are suspected but not yet proven. In assembling all the known garden evidence for the first time, we aim to expand the scope of research on Roman gardens, as well as to stimulate further field research. The project further aims to preserve this evidence in a stable digital format for future generations.
At the launch of this project, we are publishing the entries assembled by Wilhelmina Jashemski and a team of area editors working between 1988-2007. We are immediately updating and adding entries for more recently discovered gardens. New editorial teams will be reaching out to archaeologists, and we invite readers to contact us with new contributions!

It had been considered that this area was a bath complex from the time of Septimius Severus, but recent excavations and studies have shown at least part to have been occupied by the Domitianic building phase. Until the time of Maxentius, who built baths, this private wing of the palace was intended for otium and open-air promenades and was embellished with vast areas of gardens, pools and fountains.

Mausoleum Augusti (Pleiades)
Keywords altars (religious fixtures) horologium nemus (grove) obelisk statues ustrins (crematories) Garden Description The Mausoleum of Augustus was located in the northern Campus Martius between the Via Flaminia and the Tiber. The exact bounds of the park are unknown, but they stretched from north of the Mausoleum of Augustus to south of the horologium and the Ara Pacis, which was located along the Via Flaminia.
Mausoleum Augusti
Between 28 and 23 BCE, the emperor Augustus erected his Mausoleum in the northern Campus Martius within a public park composed of trees (silvae) and walks (ambulationes) (Strabo 5.3.8; Suet. Aug. 100; Dio Cassius 53.30.5). According to Strabo (5.3.8), evergreen trees (άειθαλης) were thickly planted on the vault of the mausoleum up to the summit where a bronze statue of Augustus stood. Excavations of the Mausoleum were carried out in 1869, 1871–1872, 1907–1908, 1916–1930 and 1934–1938. During the excavations conducted under Mussolini (1934–1938), all post-antique structures associated with the Mausoleum were removed. These excavations did not reveal additional information about the plantings and nature of the summit of the Mausoleum.
Reconstructions of the Mausoleum vary with regard to the depiction of the trees and summit of the mound. Strabo says that the evergreen trees were planted thickly. Most reconstructions place Italian cypresses (Cupressus sempervirens) atop the structure, and cypresses are planted on the remains of the Mausoleum today. L. Richardson rejected this idea in favor of smaller trees, such as junipers (Juniperis communis), on the basis of the structural damage that the cypress roots would have caused. However, Romans routinely manipulated trees and plants; therefore, ancient gardening techniques would have permitted the cypresses to be dwarfed and adapted for this type of planting (Plin. HN 16.139–42). Cypress trees were often planted in funerary contexts (Plin. HN 16.139–40). Without additional evidence, it is impossible to confirm which type of evergreen was planted upon the Mausoleum. Some reconstructions place a circular colonnade on the summit as a base for the statue. While there is no mention of such a structure in the ancient sources, the statue must have been placed on some sort of elevated mound to be visible above the trees, because the Mausoleum was visible from the Tiber (Strabo 5.3.8; Tacitus Ann. 3.9).
Silvae et ambulationes
Surrounding the Mausoleum were trees (silvae) and walks (ambulationes). Strabo referred to this region as a precinct or grove (άλσος) with pleasant walks (περιπάτος). Bounded by the Tiber and the Via Flaminia, the park was open to the public in 28 BCE (Suet. Aug. 100). No archaeological excavations illuminate the layout of these walks or the trees planted. These gardens also held many altars, including the Ara Pacis.
Horologium Augusti
Between 13 and 9 BCE Augustus initiated the building of the Ara Pacis; he also erected the Horologium Augusti, a sundial. The Mausoleum and its grove were connected to the rest of Augustus’ park by the horologium. Begun in 10 BCE and dedicated in 9 BCE, the sundial was a celebration of Augustus’ Egyptian victory. The red granite Egyptian obelisk (30 m. H.), known as the Montecitorio Obelisk, was brought as booty from Egypt by Augustus. It served as the gnomon for the sundial, casting its shadow on the monumental travertine plaza inlaid with bronze notations. Novius Facundus designed the horologium and modified the obelisk to have a rounded globe at its peak to cast precise shadows (Pliny HN 36.72–76).
In 1976, E. Bucher proposed that the gnomon cast a 150 m. shadow directly across the altar of the Ara Pacis on September 23, Augustus’ birthday. He uncovered part of what he believed to be part of the Meridian line of the sundial (although the phase he discovered dated to the Flavian era) with cross bars and signs of the zodiac in Greek, showing how the sundial worked as a calendar and wind index in the cellar floor of no. 48 Via di Campo. Using digital reconstructions with shadow and light simulations in combination with further archival work and archaeological coring in the Campus Martius, a team of scholars working under the direction of B. Frischer has demonstrated that in fact there were many solar and shadow alignments between the obelisk and the Ara Pacis (on 238 days of the year). These alignments would have played into Augustan themes of peace, family, stability, and fertility, as well as the triumphal victory over Egypt.
Ara Pacis
The Ara Pacis is the most famous piece of Augustan monumental sculpture in Rome. Dedicated in 9 BCE on Livia’s birthday, the Altar of Peace was a celebration of Augustus’ Pax Romana. Located adjacent to the Via Flaminia, there is no specific evidence for its park setting; however, the sculptural reliefs, especially the vegetation depicted in the lower register of the marble wall that encloses the altar, contributed to the overall themes of the Augustan campus that celebrated fertility, family, and peace among others. It was reconstructed in 1938 from fragments, and Mussolini moved it next to the Mausoleum of Augustus from its original location, just to the west of the Via Flaminia.
Ustrinum
Strabo (5.3.8) also described Augustus’s funeral kaύστρα (or crematorium), which scholars traditionally called the ustrinum, as enclosed by white marble walls surrounded by black poplars (Populus nigra / αίγειρος) and then by a circular iron fence.
Six large travertine slabs with inscriptions that refer to different members of the imperial household were discovered in 1777 in the area of Piazza S. Carlo al Corso, near the Mausoleum of Augustus (CIL VI 888–93). Three of these stones—interpreted either as orthostat cippi or as paving stones—are inscribed with the phrase HIC CREMATVS EST. Based on these inscriptions, scholars assumed that this was the ustrinum described by Strabo where Augustus’ body was cremated in 14 CE. V. Jolivet has since demonstrated otherwise. In 1937, remains from the 2nd C CE were unearthed demonstrating the circular structure described by Strabo is in fact too far north to be in the middle of the plain he described it. The cremations of other important Julio-Claudians, including the three of the children of Germanicus who died as infants during the reign of Augustus and the elder brother the future emperor Gaius (Suet., Calig. 7.1, 8.2) were commemorated here. While these remains are post-Augustan in date, they are associated with the cremation of members of the imperial household which underscores the imperial overtones of this part of the Campus Martius. The location of Augustus’s funeral pyre remains unknown.
The park where the Mausoleum of Augustus, the Ara Pacis, Horologium, and other altars were located, made the entire northern Campus Martius a celebration of Augustus’s life, achievements, and death.

Garden Description This small garden was located at the rear of the house and featured a portico on part of the south side and a gutter along the south and east sides which carried water to the cistern. Preserved on the rear wall was one of the best animal paintings found in Pompeii, with three large openings provided in the painting to accommodate garden lights. On either side of the animal painting at the lower part of the wall is a garden painting with a sphinx crouching in oleanders with dark red blossoms holding a fountain basin. The fountain on the right would appear to pour water into the actual gutter below. A realistic border of myrtle (Myrtus communis L.) and ivy (Hedera helix L.) is painted along the bottom of the wall with birds flying across a red background. Just above this, branches of ivy are painted along the bottom of an expansive wild animal scene. A bull is being pursued by a lion across a rocky lake shore on the lower foreground, wolves and wild boars occupy the center of the picture on the opposite shore, on the right a leopard is chasing two rams, and two gazelles are painted on the left. Brackets for garden lights had been installed where three large holes remained in this animal painting. The outside walls of the apotheca (storeroom) on the southwest corner of the garden had painted garden motifs. There was a garden scene painted on a reddish background depicting a statue of a water nymph with a two handled basin appearing to catch water from the roof and directing it to the gutter below. To the left are bushes with a tawny owl (Strix aluco L.) and to the right is a white pigeon or rock dove (Columba livia Gmelin). Over this was a panel with two peacocks (Pavo cristatus L.) facing a bronze garden ornament that consists of a leafy stalk topped by a round shield. Flowering plants fill in the bottom while the top of the panel is graced with two garlands and two flying birds, a swallow (Hirundo rustica L.) on the left and a large headed bird on the right which could be a shrike (Lanius sp.) Although the outside wall of the apotheca was badly damaged, to the right of the window paintings of a bush with red blossoms and a myrtle bush on a yellow background survived. The east and west walls were decorated with large Egyptian landscapes. Another garden decoration, a marble dove (0.29 m. long) was found in the kitchen.

Excavations carried out during the 1930s by A. Bartoli, and in the 1950s by G. F. Carettoni concentrated primarily on the central area of this site. These campaigns revealed the foundations of a large temple, which Bartoli identified, consistent with the earlier ideas of P. Bigot, as the remains of the late second-century Temple of Elagabalus.
Recent investigations by the Soprintendenza Archeologica in collaboration with École française de Rome have revealed further episodes of the history of the area.
Approximately one third of the site has been explored, although the most ancient levels have been reached only sporadically (Fig. 2). The information gathered during the campaigns carried out annually between 1985 and 1999 are at present being analyzed, with the result that some of the information presented here must be considered provisional. The excavations that reached levels prior to the rise of the Empire revealed a peristyle of a large domus once decorated with plants and basins. Probably destroyed during the 60s of the first century CE, this luxurious dwelling was then buried under thick layers of soil used to create an artificial terrace that was a grand garden of the Palace of Domitian. About a century later, during the last years of the second century, this section of the Imperial palace was demolished to make room for a monumental complex centered around a temple dedicated by the emperor Heliogabalus to the eastern god, Elagabalus, later rededicated by Severus Alexander to Jupiter Ultor.

Keywords aedes columns (architectural elements) exedrae (site elements) lucus (grove) porticoes temples (buildings) Garden Description The Aedes Hercules Musarum was located in the southern Campus Martius. It was enclosed by the Porticus Philippi (61 x 92 m.) in the late Republican period. Known from several fragments of the Forma Urbis Romae (Figs. 1–2), it was also adjacent (to the northwest) to the Porticus Octaviae. M. Fulvius Nobilior, consul in 189 BCE (and censor with M. Aemilius Lepidus in 179 BCE), may have built the temple between 187 and 179 BCE (Eumen. Pan. 5.7.3) after his triumph. Ovid (Fast. 6.801–2) and Suetonius (Aug. 29.5) state that L. Marcius Philippus (who had a triumph in 34 or 33 BCE) restored the temple and built the portico around it.
Knowledge of the complex derives primarily from the marble plan and ancient sources. The complex consisted of a circular aedes (temple) dedicated to Hercules Musarum (Hercules of the Muses) set within a porticus (Fig. 2). In the mid-1980s, P.A. Gianfrotta excavated a small part of the central edifice, discovering a small interior corridor (1 m. wide), restored in the imperial period. These excavations demonstrated that few alterations had been made to the original structure, suggesting that the Forma Urbis Romae depicts the original portico. The temple was located on a south-facing podium (c. 48 x 21 m., H 3.5 m) with an exedra (diam. 11 m). On the sides of podium were a series of twelve niches (W. 3.5 m), where the fasti may have been displayed (Macrob. Sat. 1.12.16). North of the podium were nine bases, possibly for statues for the nine Muses of Ambracia (Plin. HN 35.66; Ov. Fast. 6.797–812).
The FUR shows that the temple was surrounded by two rows of dots that are closely, but not perfectly, aligned. Richardson argued the dots represent a double portico; however, Castagnoli argues that the inner row of dots were trees. The different spacing of the inner dots (4–5 m.) and of the outer dots (3–4 m.) would also prove problematic in a double portico and lends support to Castagnoli’s interpretation. The elevation difference between the portico and ground level was also c. 3 m., further supporting Castagnoli’s interpretation. Thus, the dots could be interpreted as a lucus (or grove), perhaps of the poplars associated with the cult of Hercules and a flood-tolerant species suitable to the Campus Martius.
The collegium poetarum (Val. Max. 3.7.11; Plin. HN 34.19) formally gathered near the complex, and so perhaps the porticus and its exedra could have housed a poetics school with an auditorium for lectures, discussions of poetry and works of art; perhaps functioning like an Alexandrian-inspired Museion.
Figures Figs. 1-2: Hercules Musarum on the FUR. Fig. 3: Base plan (from Coarelli). Fig. 4: A base plan with two potential reconstructions of the porticus. The porticus was at a significantly higher level than the interior courtyard. No connection (i.e. steps) is identified on the plan. Either a raised temple or porticus are possible. The following two sections illustrate the difference in elevations. The second option shows the portico at ground level and the temple elevated. This would allow for access to and from portico and temple. (Linda Anderson). Dates built between 187 and 179 BCE; restoration and portico in Late Republican era (post 33 BCE)

Garden Description At the rear of this house a masonry wall surrounded the small garden which was undergoing extensive repairs at the time of the eruption. A lararium niche was located on the east wall and the rear wall held remnants of a garden painting. This painting was evidently in poor condition at the time of the eruption. Maiuri mentions the painting in his excavation report: “una grande parete dipinta con una pittura di paesaggio.” A detailed description is given by Della Corte who stated that the viridarium was given the illusion of enlargement by the paintings of woodland trees and flowering plants. He reported the usual lattice fence painted in the foreground with a tetrastyle pavilion and a statue of a winged female sphinx painted at each end of the fence. Oscilla were painted to appear to hang from the upper border of the large wall. A painting of Orpheus charming the beasts was barely visible on the right side of the wall. Seated on a dark red cloak between gigantic rocks in a landscape, his lyre against his leg, a variety of animals approached him. A section of the painting that survived on the right depicted a peacock, a goose, a cock, a wild boar, and a large black guinea hen. The painting was photographed at the time of excavation in 1929 (Mus. Naz. negative C/1614). Jashemski examined this site in 1964 and found part of a narrow panel still visible to the right of the large panel, although covered by vines. This panel was separated from the rest by a dark vertical stripe. At the bottom a lattice fencehad daisy-like flowers growing through it, with both rounded and pointed petals. Above the fence two roughly painted cypress trees (Cupressus sempervirens L.) flank several bushes which are not Acacia vera as suggested by Grimal. Jashemski notes that Grimal wrote his description on the basis of one sentence of Maiuri and the Museo Nazionale photograph included in Maiuri’s report. He also had Warscher’s photograph of the sphinx detail from the large panel but could not identify where it was located in the large panel. Jashemski also speculated that it was likely there had been an identical narrow panel on the other side of the large panel, but all the plaster had fallen leaving no trace of decorations. The best preserved section of the painting that Jashemski found was a large bush painted on the left side of the large panel. The bush could not be identified by the form of the fruit and/or flowers but perched in the bush was a crudely depicted owl identified as Athene noctua (Scopoli, 1769) by way of its big head and hefty legs. Another bird was painted on a higher branch to the right which may have been a thrush. Another bush just below and to the right edge of the painting and a large cypress to the right of the bush with the owl was shown in the Museo Nazionale (negative C/1614).

Garden Description A partially completed wall joined the columns supporting the portico at the rear of this house. Next to this was a small garden which was in an extreme state of ruin at the time of excavation due to the weakening of the wine cellar vaults below. The vaults had openings to admit light and air for the wine ageing and a cistern was also located under the garden. On the portico to the east there was a large terra-cotta puteal. A room on the south end of the east portico contains a garden representation on the west wall. Barely a third of the representation survived and what remains is extremely faded. It is painted in yellow on a small dark green panel in the center of a red wall and shows a pergola with a lattice fences extending from both sides and a section of fence in front.

The rooms had been remodeled to serve as a shop and at the time of the eruption, were in disrepair. Four columns, two of tufa, two of brick, supported the peristyles (Roman courtyards) portico on the north and east sides and were connected by a low wall with an entrance to the garden on the east side. A terra-cotta puteal was located on the east side of the portico. The house to the rear was completely destroyed necessitated the building of a crude doghouse in the last intercolumniation on the east side. Keeping a dog would have prevented intruders from entering through the ruins and robbing the shop as well as the adjacent house (no. 11) where the shopkeeper most likely resided.

Thermae Agrippae (Pleiades)
Keywords bathhouses (water recreation structures) gymnasiums horti thermae Garden Description Knowledge of this thermae, or bathing complex, and its associated public gardens comes from textual evidence and the Severan marble plan (FUR) (Figs. 1–2). Located in the central Campus Martius, Agrippa’s thermae were associated with his horti; upon his death in 12 BCE, he left both to the Roman people, free of charge (Cass. Dio 54.29.4).
The horti included a grove with plane trees and an artificial lake. Starting in 25 BCE, Agrippa constructed a gymnasium which he called Laconian sudatorium, after the Spartans who were famous for their exercise regimens (Cass. Dio 53.27.1). After 19 BCE, the Aqua Virgo supplied the complex and its grounds with an abundant source of fresh water (Frontinus Aq. 1.10), transforming it into a park and full-fledged bathing complex, the first of the imperial thermae.
In this complex, a grove (alsos) was situated between two manmade bodies of water (Strabo 13.1.19): a stagnum (lake) and a euripus (canal). The baths contained famous paintings and elaborate decoration, while Agrippa placed famous works of art, including sculptures of animals, including a bronze bear (Martial Ep. 3.19.1–2), and a lion by Lysippus (Strabo 13.1.19) in the grove. In front of the complex was the famous Apoxyomenos (the body scraper), also by Lysippus (Plin. HN 34.62). The Hecatostylum, lying just south of the euripus, may have served as a covered walkway for the grove and functioned as a de facto boundary of the complex (Martial 3.19.1-2).
Seneca the Younger reports that he used to celebrate the new year by jumping into the cold canal (associated with the Aqua Virgo) (Ep. 83.5); this suggests that the stagnum and euripus were also recreational spaces for the people of Rome. While there is no direct reference to swimming in the stagnum, the lake was large enough space that Nero was able to enjoy a sumptuous banquet, while floating on a raft (Tac. Ann. 15.37), suggesting that the stagnum could have recreational purposes.
The thermae burned in the fire of 80 CE (Cass. Dio 66.24) and was restored quickly by Titus or Domitian (Martial 3.20.15, 36.6). Restorations by Hadrian, Constantius and Constans are known. According to Sidonius Apollinarus, the baths are mentioned in the regionary catalogues and were still in use in the fifth century CE (Carm. 23.496).

Keywords altars (religious fixtures) canals (waterways) columns (architectural elements) exedrae (site elements) porticoes temples (buildings) triumphal arch Garden Description The Divorum, also known as the Templum Divorum (Degrassi 13.1.103, 233) and the Porticus Divorum, was a porticus with two small temples built in honor of Titus and Vespasian by Domitian, who constructed the complex after the first of 80 CE on the site of the Villa Publica (Chronographer of 354 CE). The Divorum, known from its depiction on the Severan marble plan (Fig.1), is located on the eastern Campus Martius among other religious structures, including the Temple of Minerva Chalcidica, which visually integrated with the Divorum.
The porticus complex (220 x 55m) (Fig. 2) consists of a northern entry in the form of a triumphal arch, flanked on the inside by two small temples (Fig. 2, a and b), while at the southern end of the central axis lay a stepped altar or pool (Fig. 2, c). The enclosing porticoes featured 30-33 columns on the east and west sides, with 16-17 columns on the south. The porticoes, as depicted, featured only two exedrae: one irregularly placed on the east side, and one terminating the central axis at the south. Shaded walks are indicated on the marble plan by dots representing ranks of trees in the central space: two rows of 13 trees lined the western side, while one row of 12 and one row of 11 lined the eastern side (Fig. 3). The lack of symmetry may have been intentional: the open space permits a clear view and movement between the entrance and the front of the east exedra. Perspective studies indicate a visual relationship between the southern exedra, the altar/pool, and the framed view of the Temple of Minerva Chalcidica from within the strolling grounds.
From the northern exedra, a water channel appears to lead to the altar or pool, which is stepped up or down on the north and south, depending upon the interpretation of the feature. Another water channel appears along the interior western edge of the porticus. The Amnis Petronia passes by the complex at the northwest corner.

Keywords exedrae (site elements)] fountains oeci peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes stucco tablina triclinia (rooms) Garden House of the Citharist (also known as the Casa Del Citarista, House of L. Popidius Secundus Agustianus, and L. Popidus Ampliatus), a domestic property with peristyles (Roman courtyards) gardens.
Garden Description A. Excavation took place at this large house intermittently form 1853 to 1869. There were three large parallel, adjacent gardens. A portico, supported by seventeen stuccoed columns made of brick and Sarno limestone, enclosed the center garden. The columns were red, fluted at the top and plain at the bottom. A gutter went around the perimeter of the garden. A semicircular basin was located at the west end of the garden around which six spectacular bronze animals were discovered in 1861. The bronzes were as follows: a boar with a fountain spouting from its mouth (0.56m high; Mus. Naz. inv. no. 4900); two dogs (0.51 and 0.25m. high; for boar and dogs); a leaping stag with no trace of fountain fittings (0.61m high; Mus. Naz. inv. no. 4902; Reusch no. 823); a lion with an open mouth, possibly for a fountain, which originally stood on his hind legs (0.39m high; Mus. Naz. inv. no. 4897; Reusch no. 820); a serpent with a spout in its mouth (0.51m high; Mus. Naz. inv. no. 4898; Reusch no. 822). The Museo Nazionale was said to have preserve the original placements of the statues. After careful study of this Dwyer concluded that the boar would have stood on the projecting spur of the fountain basin with the dogs attacking his from either side of the rim. The leaping lion would have been next to them and the serpent to their right. The stag would have stood on the rim of the basin at the extreme left. The entire group could have been seen from the large room opening off the west portico, which was lacking one column to facilitate the view (Eschebach incorrectly included this column on his plan). Two double herms, each representing Bacchus and Ariadne, were found at the edge of the basin. Dwyer was not able to locate these. There eleven marble oscilla, six circular ones (tondi) (Mus. Naz. inv. nos. 6551, 6642, 6646, 6652, formerly 6667 but now at Pompeii, inv. no. 20486, one with inv. no. unknown). Five had the shape of a pelta (Mus. Naz. inv. no. 6660, 6661, 6664, 6665, formerly 6658 but now at Pompeii, inv. no. 20489). These white marble oscillae each had an iron hook at the top, but no rod, which indicates that were suspended from the architrave between the columns by a cord. Dwyer suggests that the peltae were probably alternated with the round shields. One oscillum had a maenad on one side; the rest had a faun or satyr on each side. A large rectangular pool (3.50m wide x 10.80m long; 1.40m deep) was excavated in February 1926 by Maruri. Two high steps (0.45m and 0.40m) descended into the pool on the west side. A much smaller semicircular pool had been built around these steps and into the larger pool which had been filled with rubble. This was probably built after the earthquake when the entrance on the Via dell’Abbondanza was joined to the house. The cistern opening in the southwest corner of the garden had a lave puteal, but the one in the east portico had no puteal. To the northeast of garden there was a large room which contained garden representations painted on the black predella under both of the side panels on the south wall. These were recorded by Spinazzola in drawings.
B. The center peristyles (Roman courtyards) was separated from the south peristyles (Roman courtyards) by a long wall that had six windows and two doors. These offered a grand view into the southern peristyles (Roman courtyards). In an earlier period this peristyles (Roman courtyards) must have been considered the most important component for each of the six windows corresponded to an intercolumniation in the southern peristyles (Roman courtyards). The twenty portico columns were fluted above, plain below, and faced with stucco over brick and Sarno limestone. The northeast corner had a portico with a marble puteal. This garden was bounded by a gutter and in this peristyles (Roman courtyards) there was a white marble altar (0.255m high; Mus. Naz. inv. no. 110 022). The middle peristyles (Roman courtyards) was supposedly where the famous bronze statue of Apollo playing a cithara (1.58m high with base; Mus. Naz. inv. no. 5630; Reusch no. 831) was found on November 8, 1853. It probably came from the southeast corner of the southern peristyles (Roman courtyards) for the middle peristyles (Roman courtyards) was not excavated until five years after the Apollo was found. Niccolini was the first to mistakenly report the location where the bronze was discovered. Maiuri thought that the Apollo may have been adapted as a lychnophoros. Several smaller rooms looked out over the garden as well as a large oecus on the east.
C. The north peristyles (Roman courtyards) garden belonged originally to a house whose entrance was on the Via dell’Abbondanza. It was accessed by a flight of steps from the central peristyles (Roman courtyards) which lies about two meters below. A portico surrounded this garden on the south, east, and most of the north sides. Between the two middle columns on the east side there was a travertine puteal. A large exedra proceeded by a vestibule offered a view of the garden from the west, as did the triclinium from the east. The columns were made of brick and Sarno sandstone and faced with stucco, just like the ones in the central peristyles (Roman courtyards). They were unfluted except the ones opposite the entrances to the large exedra, the triclinium, and the atrium to the north. A gutter surrounded the garden.

Garden Description This small house, excavated in 1872, had no atrium and the peristyles (Roman courtyards) garden was to the right of the north end of the entrance passageway. A portico enclosed the garden on the west, north, and part of the south sides. Part of the portico had been closed to make rooms. Paintings of amorini decorated the peristyles (Roman courtyards) with two little busts that may have been portraits of the owners. A lararium painting and an arched niche were located in the west wall of the peristyles (Roman courtyards). A small marble column with bas-relief of foliage most likely served as garden decoration.

Garden Description A. This house had an irregular plan and a small peristyles (Roman courtyards) garden enclosed on three sides by a low masonry wall. The wall was topped by four stuccoed brick columns which supported the portico. The excavation in 1869-72 showed that restoration was in progress at the time of the eruption. Inside the triclinium a small marble head of Bacchus from a herm (Mus. Naz. inv. no. 110 653) was found as well as a small marble ram (Mus. Naz. inv. no. 120 357), both probably garden decorations.
B. The viridarium lay across the entire width of the house to the rear. The west (rear) of the peristyles (Roman courtyards) garden was completely open to the viridarium.

Garden Description At the rear of the house, excavated in 1868, there was a peristyles (Roman courtyards) garden with a portico supported by three brick columns on the east and north sides. The south wall had a lararium painting and a crude animal painting on one corner of the south garden wall. This had been executed in the manner of a topiary painting according to the excavators, who reported a lion consuming a deer, below which there was a dog pouncing on a hare. A good view of the garden was obtained through the triclinium on the north.

Garden Description This site was excavated in 1868 revealing a peristyles (Roman courtyards) garden at the rear of the house. A portico on the east and north side was supported by five columns connected by a low wall. There was an opening to the garden on the north. The middle of the garden had two cistern puteals. The west wall of the garden held the famous painting depicting the battle between the Nucerians and the Pompeians in the amphitheatre (1.60m high by a little less than 2.00m wide; Mus. Naz. Inv. No. 112 222; Ruesch no. 1344). This event was recorded by Tacitus (Annals 14.17). A gutter went along the east, south, and north edges of the garden.

The public porticus was constructed on the site of the grand domus of Publius Vedius Pollio, who bequeathed his property to Augustus upon his death.
Augustus constructed the porticus in the name of his wife, Livia. With her son Tiberius, Livia dedicated the complex to Concordia in January 7 BCE. (Ovid Fast. 6.637–48; Suet. Aug. 29; Dio Cassius 54.23.6, 55.8.2). The complex was accessed via two flights of stairs from the Clivus Suburanus.
The porticus (ca. 120 x 75 m.) was enclosed by an outer wall and a roofed double colonnade. There are large rectangular and circular exedrae set behind the individual porticoes. In the center of the porticus was a large rectangular central feature, and four small features were located at the corners of the colonnades. Scholars debate whether the large central feature was a fountain or, more likely, a shrine to Concordia, dedicated to marital concord and harmony, a major theme of Augustan propaganda. Ovid mentions a shrine to Concordia Ovid Fast. 6.637–48. The function of the four smaller features located at the corners of the colonnades is also uncertain; perhaps, they were fountains or small niches for the display of statues.
The porticus featured a central garden. Pliny writes of a single, productive vine stock that covered the walkway with shade (Pliny, HN 14.11), creating a pergolas-like effect. The vines were also productive, reportedly producing twelve amphorae of wine per year. A collection of paintings was also displayed in the porticus (Ovid, Ars Am. 171–72; Strabo 5.3.8). As in other porticoes, Romans would stroll, meet their lovers, or make appointments to meet each other here (Plin. Ep. 1.5.9).
Excavations in 1984 identified pre- and post-Augustan phases, but provided no information about possible gardens. The excavations suggest that the porticus remained in use until the fifth century CE, but that by the mid-sixth century the porticus was being used for burials.

Keywords cryptoportici domus exedrae (site elements) nemus (grove) nymphaea (garden structures) peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes stagnum (man-made lake) terrace gardens Garden Description Famous for its innovative architecture, the Domus Aurea contained equally impressive gardens. After the fire of 64 CE, Nero erected this monumental residence, replacing the damaged Domus Transitoria. While the exact boundaries of the property are unknown, it is generally thought to have extended from the palaces of the Palatine, across the Velian and Oppian Hills to the Horti Maecenatis and the Horti Lamiani on the Esquiline, down into the valley and up to the Temple of the Divine Claudius on the Caelian Hill (Fig.1). Gardens and an artificial lake (stagnum were constructed in this valley, where the Colosseum now stands. Based on the ancient sources (Suet. Ner. 31.1–2; Tacitus Ann. 15.42.1), scholars interpreted these gardens as naturalistic, but recent excavations have challenged this view.
The wing of the palace on the Oppian Hill was composed of sophisticated architecture and decoration typical of elite Horti and suburban villas. The wing was oriented north-south and had commanding southern views over the valley and lake toward the Caelian (Fig. 2). The complex probably contained two peristyles (Roman courtyards), which could have been planted, and two exedrae flanking the octagonal room may have contained gardens. Recently discovered retaining walls confirm that the palace was constructed on terraces, which are likely to have held gardens. Photographs from the 1870s excavations show large numbers of ollae perforatae (planting pots) being removed, suggesting a highly constructed landscape.
The stagnum was located in the valley between the Palatine, Oppian, Esquiline and Caelian Hills. According to the ancient authors, Nero erected buildings around the stagnum which looked like cities, as well as terraces of cultivated land, intermixed with woods of wild animals, and pastures of domesticated animals (Suet. Ner. 31.1–2; Tac. Ann. 15.42.1). Therefore, scholars envisioned the stagnum as a naturalistic lake set into a rustic, unstructured landscape dotted with groups of architecture. Excavations in the late twentieth century indicate that the stagnum was rectilinear and enclosed by a vast portico. The hydraulic system for this lake was utilized in the Flavian amphitheater that replaced it. This would suggest the landscape was more structured (terraced and planned) and the effect might have been akin to the paintings of villa landscapes that survive from Pompeii and the Bay of Naples. Excavations have also shown that the colossal statue of Nero was enclosed by a pi-shaped (or triple) porticus, lending further support for an interpretation of constructed, planned gardens.
The Domus Tiberiana on the Palatine was incorporated into the Domus Aurea. Resting on cryptoporticoes and vaulted substructures, the palace was surrounded by colonnades which opened onto a hanging garden (nemora pensile), accessible from the Forum by a grand staircase on the north and another to the east.
The unfinished Temple to the Divine Claudius became a monumental nymphaeum. The eastern wall of the temple platform was transformed into an ornamental niched façade with abundant fountain jets fed by a new branch of the Aqua Claudia. The brick remains of this nymphaeum are visible today along the [Via Claudia](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/688514720(Fig. 3). The water features drained into the stagnum.

Garden Description A. On the right of the tablinum were ten steps that led to the peristyles (Roman courtyards) garden. A portico enclosed the garden on the west, north and east sides. This was supported by ten columns and two engaged columns which were stuccoed brick painted red. The north, east, and west edges of the garden had a gutter. There were two cistern openings, according to Mau, one located in the northeast corner of the garden with a tufa puteal and the other in the corresponding corner of the portico. Water emptied at the northeast corner from the gutter into the cistern and into the street at the southeast and southwest corners. An aqueduct pipe came out of the first column, (counting from the south on the west portico), and ran between the gutter and the portico. The pipe rose, supported from the second column on the west side, to spurt a jet of water in the gutter. Flanking the west and the north porticoes, it disappeared going to the northwest. On the west side it was possible in two places to let water flow into the gutter by a widening of the pipe. The gutter had openings to the gardens at these two points to serve as watering outlets. There were keys before and after the widen pipe sections to control the flow of water. Two branches of this pipe entered a room off the northwest corner of the peristyles (Roman courtyards) where there was a basin.
B. The front of this house excavated in 1869 had an unusual design in that it was set back some distance from the street. The peristyles (Roman courtyards) garden was entered at the end of the entranceway at the rear of a long angiprotus (alleyway). Rooms of the house were located at the right and rear of the garden. The peristyles (Roman courtyards) had undergone various changes and was supported on the east and north by tall tufa columns. The portico roof on the west was supported by two low brick columns and two pilasters surmounted by arches. A low wall enclosed the garden, joining the columns either side of the entrance between the two columns to the west. A terracotta puteal was adjacent to the west wall along with a hearth covered with a small vault decorated with a rough, bearded head supposed to be Vulcan. A large window on the south wall gave a view from the exedra into the garden. The east peristyles (Roman courtyards)wall contained a lararium niche and a gutter ran along the north, east, and west edges of the garden.

Garden Description At the rear of the house there was a peristyle garden with a portico along the east side and part of the south. The excavation took place in 1873-74. A low wall joined three stuccoed brick columns and two engaged ones which supported the portico. There was an entrance to the garden on the south side opposite the door from the tablinum and another on the east opposite the kitchen door, which was closed later according to Mau. The columns were white above the height of the wall and red below. Water was carried to the cistern by a wide gutter on the south and east edges of the garden, and Mau found some evidence of aqueduct water.
There was a masonry triclinium (l. medius, 5.30 m; l. imus, 3.85 m; l. summus, 2.70 m) with a circular table (dia. of support, 0.70 m) built against the west wall. Inside of each couch there were four niches (0.19 m wide). The last niche in the south couch was larger in size and separated from the other three by the mouth of the cistern. There was a small masonry podium on the north wall with steps for access. A round tufa altar was located opposite the lectus summus.

Garden Description The garden east of the atrium had a portico extending along the south and part of the west sides. A low wall (0.52m high) connected the columns and an entrance to the garden was located on the west. In 1873 the caupona was excavated. The garden contained a masonry triclinium (l. medius, 3.85m; l. summus and l. imus, 3.20m) with a table. The badly damaged triclinium revealed the amphorae used in its construction. A low podium along the north wall was thought by Fiorelli to have held flowerpots. Mau reported a drainage channel at the corner of the triclinium formed by the l. meduis and the l. summus, although it is no longer evident. The base of an aedicules lararium remains against the east wall opposite the north end of the east couch.

Keywords atriums (Roman halls) peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes tablina Garden A small garden with pools to the rear of a domestic property, in addition to one peristyle garden with decorative elements.
Garden Description A. At the rear of the house was a very small garden entered from the tablinum. Excavated in 1872, much of the garden was occupied by two small raised pools, according to Mau. Attached to the west wall was a masonry pool 0.58 m deep on the inside and 0.73 m high on the outside. The other pool was to the south and there was a garden painting on the rear wall.
B. The peristyles (Roman courtyards) garden to the east of the atrium was excavated in 1873. It had a portico on the north and west supported by two pillars, one at the northwest corner and the other in the middle of the north side. A gutter sloped towards the southeast corner as it went around the east, north, and west edges of the garden. A shrine-like structure was built against the east wall with the marble veneered façade above the level of the floor of the niche. The niche contained a marble statuette of Venus, her left arm supported by a statuette (1.04 m high; Mus Naz. inv. no. 109 608; Ruesch no. 1325). The wall behind the statue was painted to represent blue drapery and the ceiling had a shell-like fluting. Two small marble statuettes of toads (Mus. Nac. inv. no. 109 609, 109 610) found in the garden and probably the one of two doves (Mus. Naz. inv. no. 120 407) found in the tablinum decorated the flowerbeds. There was also a marble head of a man identified as Agrippa, found cemented in a cup (total height 0.285 m; Mus. Nac. inv. no. 109 611; Reusch no. 1081). The marble statuette of Hercules wrapped in a lion skin (0.70 m high; Mus. Nac. inv. no. 109 677) found in the atrium was probably a garden decoration. The large room on the north had a fine view of the garden and the east and south walls of the garden were decorated with garden paintings. These were separated by narrow panels with a painting of a candelabrum, according to Mau, and each painting featured a fence with an amphora upon it. Behind this there was a thicket with birds. On either side of the amphora there was an ibis, and a pheasant in the center. Fiorelli mentioned observing animals in the paintings. Jashemski notes that no trace of the paintings remained when she examined the site; she has never seen a pheasant represented in any garden paintings.

Keywords aedicules lararia porticoes Garden Peristyle garden with decorative elements.
Garden Description This house was excavated in 1873. The entranceway led directly to the portico which enclosed the garden on the north and east. In the northwest corner of the portico a masonry aedicules lararium formed an arched niche on top of a solid podium. A low wall connected the columns and pillars of the portico. There was an entrance to the garden on the east side and a gutter along the east and north edges of the garden. A terracotta statuette of a seated old man holding a scroll in his right hand and wearing a short sleeved tunic (0.60 m high; Mus. Naz. Inv. No. 109 622; Ruesh no. 453) served as a fountain. This statue has been variously identified, but most likely was the Greek philosopher Antisthenes (ca. 445-360), a devoted follower of Socrates. A terracotta puteal was also found in the garden.

Garden Description The west portico of the small peristyle garden at the rear of the house was entered through two doors directly from the atrium. The garden was enclosed on four sides by a portico supported by eight stuccoed brick columns. On the foreside, the two first columns on the left had a larger intercolumniation corresponding to the wide opening opposite the atrium. Between these columns stood a terracotta puteal covered with white stucco. A gutter around the edges of the garden was shown in the plan. The round pool in the center of the garden no longer exists, and only stumps of the columns remain today. One of the graffiti on the walls of the portico noted that on November 17 Puteolana gave birth to three males and two females (XV K(alendas) NOV(embres) PVTEOLANA PEPERIT MASCL(os) III FEMEL[as] II (CIL IV. 3890). Perhaps they were either piglets or puppies. Pigs were more common in ancient cities than is commonly realized.

A. Garden A (entrance 9) occupies the entire insula and is one of the largest properties in the city. It was originally excavated in 1755-1757, stripped of its works of art and re-buried. In 1951-1952, this garden was re-excavated and restored but not published. Sixteen elegantly carved slender marble pillars support a portico which borders the peristyles (Roman courtyards) garden on the west. An alcove housed a summer triclinium (l. medius, 4.00 m.; l. imus and summus 3.00 m.) with marble faced couches that looked through the portico into the garden. Between the couches a niche supplied water that ran down small marble steps to a hole at the bottom. The water re-surfaced as a jet in the middle of the triclinium. A vine covered arbor stretched along the south and east side of the garden and beyond it in bays on the east wall were raised planting beds, alternating semicircular and square. These were covered with pumice and decorated with a band of Egyptian blue around the sides and top, the middle bay having four bands of Egyptian blue. The room to the south of the triclinium had a garden representation (0.185 x 0.42 m) on the north part of the west wall on the red middle zone.
Four fish ponds connected to form a long channel (euripus) down the center of the garden. The little marble bridges that crossed the channel and covered alcoves at the bottom of the pools provided shelter for the fish and eels.
A number of statuettes were found during the two excavations of this site. More recently the pieces that were found are as follows: A marble satyr (0.475 m. preserved height; Pompeii inv. no. 8856) located at the north end of the pool, a seated terra-cotta figure of Pittacus of Mitylene (0.65 m high; Pompeii inv. no. 2181-4) found at the edge of the pool, a small marble fountain statuette of a sea crab in a shell (0.19 m wide; Pompeii inv. no. 1073/54). During the earlier excavation some of the items found were as follows: a satyr child (0.46 m high; Muz. Naz. inv. no. 6108), a nude youth holding grapes in his right hand and a goose in his left (0.76 m high; Muz. Naz. inv. no. 6342), a faun (Muz. Naz. inv. no. 6343), an old man covered with a cloth (0.49 m. high), a bird with a lizard in its beak (0.32 m. high), a marble mask of a smiling youth on a small column (0.54 m. high), and a marble relief (0.36m. long x 0.11 m. high) of an old man seated of a bench, perhaps this was a pinax. The heads of twelve marble herms, (one woman, one old man, three bearded men) were reported by PAH, but the post of only one is mentioned and only the feet of the thirteenth herm was found. A terracotta group of Caritas Romana was found in many pieces as well as multiple fragments of other terra-cotta statuettes which had been in the eleven niches in the peristyles (Roman courtyards) portico. Chambalu believed the herms stood between these niches.
B. An outdoor swimming pool (8.50 x 4.50 m; 1.50 m deep) was located in the garden area in the northeast part of the insula. There were steps into the pool on the north and south sides, and an entrance (8) into the area from the side street.
C. A walled rustic garden close to entrance 8 had been planted and at the time of the excavation; rectangular planting bed contours were evident here. This included tree root cavities were noted around the perimeter of each bed and four rectangular water basins (one of which was double), and a cistern opening.
Plans view form the portico detail of the jet. portico and garden Dates Partially excavated 1754 to 1757, 1933 to 1935, fully re-excavated 1951.

Keywords aedicules biclinia drains lararia triclinia (rooms) Garden Garden at the rear of the House of L. Vousius Faustus and M. Volusius Faustus.
Garden Description The garden at the rear of the house, excavated in 1873, is almost totally destroyed. According to Mau, most of the garden was occupied by a large pool (5m X 2.90m) which was sloped toward the west from where it drained into the street through a pipe. The pool was surrounded by a low wall about 0.55m high leaving only a narrow space between the pool and the walls. In the northwest corner were the two beds of a masonry biclinium which sloped toward the wall, as was customary. Rainwater falling on them was carried away by a terracotta drain which emptied into the pool. A square niche under the north couch provided a storage space. On the wall above this couch was a rectangular niche lararium with a roughly made aedicules facade. At the east end of this couch was a masonry table. Fiorelli reports a planting bed attached to the rear (east) wall. There was a view from the triclinium through the large window in the east wall, across the pool to the garden painting on the rear wall.
When this garden was excavated in 1873, the excavators reported three panels on the east wall with garden paintings. The center panel had a body of water with swimming fish with assorted animals in the background that included a grazing deer and a springing leopard. The two panels on either side each had a large crater-shaped fountain surrounded by thick growth. Large red flowers and yellow apples could be identified to the left of each fountain and the right, pomegranates (Punica granatum L.) Jashemski examined this painting in 1964 to find it had been covered by a growth of ivy which had destroyed most of the painting. A section of a large pomegranate bush was all that was left intact at the time. She describes the leaves, painted in blue-green with darker shading and a few yellow leaves and the fruit, deep yellow with reddish-orange shading, as being rendered in an impressionistic manner. At the right of the entrance to the garden area was a cistern opening.

Garden Large garden planted with trees and decorated with a water channel (euripus), garden paintings, garden statues, and a biclinium and triclinium](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359). Inside, a spacious peristyles (Roman courtyards) with fountains was decorated with flowers in planting boxes and ornamentals.
Garden Description A. The spacious Tuscan atrium of this luxurious house excavated in 1918-1921 was a lavish garden. A low, double masonry wall, faced with marble on the outside, bordered the impluvium and according to Spinazzola, the space between the walls had been lined with wood to form a planting box for flowers and ornamentals. The pool had a fountain base, which may have held a statuette, and bases in the center of each side may have held additional statuary. On the north side of the impluvium pipe remains, as well as the cavity where the pipe emerged from under the south base, were excavated. Bombing during WWII extensively damaged the other two sides but these have since been restored.
B. At the rear of the atrium a modest peristyles (Roman courtyards) garden was enclosed by a portico on the east, north and west sides. The supporting columns were smooth and colored red at the base, and fluted and white at the top. A very low wall joined all of the columns. Two circular beds in the center of the garden and a bed bordering the edges with a path between, entered from the south, were shown on the large plan by Spinazzola (see p.376). Although a dot in the center of each circular bed could represent a root cavity, no mention is made of soil contours or root cavities. A glazed terra-cotta statuette of Bes, the Egyptian deity (Pompeii inv. no. 2897) and of a pharaoh (Pompeii inv. no. 2898) were found but indications were that many other statuettes from this garden had been carried away by ancient excavators.
C. A vine covered portico terrace stretched across the back of the house immediately behind the peristyles (Roman courtyards). Animal paintings decorated the north wall of the terrace. There were two panels of deteriorating images that had been quickly rendered. Lions, lionesses, tigers and leopards pursuing bulls, deer, gazelles and hares were noted by Spinazzola. Jashemski recorded seeing the faded images of a deer, lion, and a bull and several unidentified images in the west panel. She reported that the east panel was in poor condition but she could make out lions and a deer being attacked by an unnamed animal. At the east end of the terrace, between two masonry couches of a biclinium (l. imus 2.78; l. summus 3.40 m.), two columns framed an aedicules niche. To the wall right of the niche was a painting of Pyramus and Thisbe, to the left a painting of Narcissus. A marble telamon in the form of a kneeling satyr (Pompeii inv. no. 2891) found on the terrace was thought by Spinazzola to have been a fountain head. This would have stood on the aedicules with a basin on his shoulders, spilling water down into the channel. Dr. Salza Prina Ricotti disagreed, pointing out that there is no evidence of piping either in the aedicules or the statuette. The channel, or euripus, measured 1.00 m. wide and 1.40 m. deep and extended 20 m. along the terrace. The inside of the channel was painted blue and small statues were set in the narrow strip of garden along the sides. Proceeding from east to west, the statues were as follows: on the south side, the head of a bearded Dionysus (Pompeii inv. no. 2910); across the channel on the north side, the bust of a young Dionysus (Pompeii inv. no. 2918); next on the south, a lion holding a ram’s head (Pompeii inv. no. 2922); across from this, a lion devouring an antelope (Pompeii inv. no. 2929); next on the south, the mask of a woman sculptured in a console (Pompeii inv. no. 2928); opposite this, a sphinx (Pompeii inv. no. 2930); next on the north side, a seated baby satyr with head and hands raised (Pompeii inv. no. 2931)(this piece disappeared in 1960); an infant Hercules strangling two serpents (Pompeii inv. no. 2932); opposite this, a greyhound attacking a hare (Pompeii inv. no. 2934). A bearded river god (Pompeii inv. no. 2932) looked down the channel from its source, and on the base between the pillars of the portico stood a statue of the Muse Polyhymnia (Pompeii inv. no. 2917) and one of Mnemosyne (Pompeii inv. no. 2909). These two marble statues bore traces of paint. The channel was crossed by two small bridges, one crossing by the biclinium. The other crossed in front of the grand triclinium opening just off the north side of the terrace. The triclinium offered a view across the bridge to a tetrastyle pavilion. Here fountains spouted water into the channel at the edge of the plinth of the pavilion. The lower garden that extended the length of the insula could be viewed from this point.
D. A nymphaeum in the lower garden was located directly under the tetrastyle pavilion. Water cascaded into this from the pavilion and the upper channel. Brightly colored paintings of fish surrounded a marble mask of a water deity on the rear wall of the nymphaeum. Just below, seated above little marble steps where the water tumbled down to the channel, was a marble amorino holding a mask (0.236 m. high; Pompeii inv. no. 20513). The narrow channel continued more than 50 meters down the length of the garden and was interrupted by three structures. Before the first pergola, three jets of water issued from two low columns and a pillar spaced evenly in the channel. The vine covered pergolas covered an elaborate fountain where water issued from the center of the structure and flowed down four steps in four directions to the pool. A small pavilion was built over the next pool and the final pool had another vine covered pergolas shading a jet of water near the end of the channel. Although this series of pools and channels varied, they were all connected as one feature. Spinazzola suggested that the pools were used for raising different species of fish which would have separate habitat requirements. Shade and cover for the fish would have been supplied by the pavilion and hollows in the first marble fountain.
There was evidence of long vine arbors on each side of the channel and cavities of large shade trees lined the side walls, although no measurements were recorded. On the east side of the garden by the row of shade trees, forty-four amphorae were found buried in the soil. Rows of smaller trees or shrubs filled the area between the shade trees and the arbors.
A masonry triclinium stood to the east of the first fountain and here two sculptured supports for a marble table were found. The west side of the covered passageway once had wooden benches, and near the wall at the south end of the garden a one-third life size statuette of a sleeping hermaphrodite (Pompeii inv. no. 3021) was discovered. An entrance from the Via di Castricio allowed direct access to the garden.

Garden Two gardens, one with root cavities and the remains of a new cistern.
Garden Description The worship of the Thracian-Phrygian vegetation god, Sabazius, took place in this large peristyles (Roman courtyards) garden which was entered through a wide vestibule from the street. Crude paintings of Venus, Mercury, Bacchus, and Priapus with their accompanying symbols were located high on the sides of the entrance. The peristyles (Roman courtyards) garden was large enough to accommodate a large assembly of worshippers who attended the sacrifices at the altar directly across from the entrance.
A large room to the back had been transformed into a sacella and had a lava threshold that indicated it could be closed off with a shutter. A square masonry altar stood before it with the iron rings to hold garlands still preserved. Offerings of perfume, incense, libations or blood sacrifice could have taken place here. The pillars either side of the door sported graffiti which included the word antrum (grotto) inscribed on the left pilaster. This word was used by Vergil to describe the dwelling of the Cumean Sibyl. There was an illustration of a nude priest (16 cm. high) with a scabellum (instrument of the nature of a castanet) in his right hand and a tambourine in his left while performing a ritual skipping dance.Across the rear wall of the sacellum stretched a large red podium which has been explained either as a base for a statue or as a couch for a sybil. Two storerooms were located to the left (north) of the sacellum and various cult objects were stored in two roughly furnished rooms to the right. The cult objects included various bronze and terra-cotta lamps, in addition to two close to life-sized bronze right hands (mantic hands associated with the worship of Sabazius). Two squat terra-cotta vases of unusual shape with a little bowl on the rim just above each handle sat near the altar. Various objects decorated the sides of the vases, including a lizard, palm leaf, serpent, toad, stairs, a syrinx, loaf of bread, bucrane, and a bunch of grapes. The vases may have served as urns for lots.
Examination of the garden revealed that it had been shaded by a row of four trees, their diameter at the surface ranging from 0.25 to 0.56 m. There was more than adequate room for the worshipers beneath the trees. The water channel noted in the entry above carried water to this garden under a door that allowed passage to the garden to the south.

Garden Two gardens, one with root cavities and the remains of a new cistern.
Garden Description A. (Entrance 7A) A square garden area was tucked behind two rooms. The beginnings of an arc-shaped structure in the northeast corner could have been the beginning of an additional cistern according to Dr. De Caro. The soil was badly damaged and Jashemski could not determine the planting patterns, although a few root cavities were recorded. Water was directed by way of a well-worn channel from under a door in II.i.12, across this garden and into garden II.i.10 to the east.
B. (Entrance 11) The two rooms in back of this area were an industrial complex, and the large rectangular area in front was entered directly from the street. This had been cleared, probably after the earthquake (AD 62), and used as a garden. The industrial areas were likely also connected to the House of the Sibyl (II.i.12) after AD 62.

Garden Description A. The access to this garden featured an arched niche high on the garden wall located either side of the direct entrance from the street at entrance 8. A further entrance (7A) from the street was located on the east wall. The masonry triclinium (l. medius, 3.60 m.; l. imus 3.20 l. summus 2.43 m.) in the northwest corner had a round table (0.55 m. in dia.) between the couches and a rectangular table (0.65 x 1.03 m.) built against the north wall. A cistern opening was found to the south of the triclinium. To the left of entrance 8, a small room was excavated in 1985 to reveal a treading floor that allowed the juice from the grapes to flow into a small dolium. This indicates that the garden was most likely planted in vines.
B. Entrance 8 opened directly into a courtyard garden. A cistern opening in the northeast corner of the garden was fed by a gutter along the east edge. To the right of the door on the east wall was a small niche lararium with an aedicules façade. To the right of this niche, a painting of Hercules was displayed in a red border. Below this was a garden setting with an altar and a crested serpent painted in low stucco relief. In the interior area of this property, stairs leading to an upper floor and a hearth in a kitchen area were located. The stairs likely led to accommodation.

Location Ostia (Pleiades)
Location Description DESCRIPTION
Ostia Antica, the port-city of Rome, was situated at the mouth (ostium) of the Tiber, where it flowed into the Tyrrhenian sea. Rome was situated further upriver, several kilometres from the sea. By its maritime position, Ostia also protected the landing at the mouth of the river; it controlled the trade that ran along it, and also the production of salt in the nearby salt works. Ancient historians believed that the city had been founded in the 7thcentury by king Ancus Marcius; archaeological evidence shows that the first settlement was founded as a colonia maritima in the 4thcentury B.C. and that it was already acting as the harbour of Rome in the 3rdcentury B.C.
From the 2ndcentury B.C. Ostia (and later Portus) was the main port for the landing of wheat and other foodstuffs destined for the markets of Rome. It was a lively and cosmopolitan port city, where the great cargo ships unloaded produce from all over the Mediterranean and beyond. At Ostia the freight was transferred to riverboats to be sent upriver to Rome. This thriving commercial activity was accompanied by demographic and economic growth and by the presence of people coming from all over the known world.
Ostia is especially well known in archaeological and historical studies for its building history. The earliest Ostian houses are only known from sporadic traces, beginning from the 2nd century B.C. They were domus of traditional type, both in the simplest version, of direct Italic derivation, with rooms arranged round the atrium, and in the more complex Roman-Hellenistic form, in which the peristyle with the garden was added (e.g. the House of the Bucrania). They were single-family houses, generally single storied, or with an upper story limited to the height of the atrium.
The transition to a different type of house was marked by the so-called peristyle house, such as the House on the Via del Tempio Rotondo, which dates to the Augustan period, the one found below the Schola of Trajan (built A.D. 20-40) and the House of the Thunderbolt, datable to the Vespasianic period (A.D. 69-79). In this latter type of house the rooms are laid out around a small central colonnaded courtyard, sometimes provided with a garden, more often paved. The later examples of this type include the first phase of the House of Fortuna Annonaria, with its garden (AD 140-190).
Ostia was heavily reconstructed in the 2ndcentury A.D., under the pressure of the growth in population due to the completion of its ports. The new city followed new canons of utilitarian, high-density building, based on the multi-storied insula, which aimed at the efficient use of the little space available. A room with windows on the façade became a kind of atrium-room. The plan became enriched with smaller rooms and internal staircases that ascended to the private apartments of the upper floor. Independent stairways entered from the street provided access to the apartments on the second and upper floors. The most accomplished examples of this type of building date to the Hadrianic period, for example in some insulae that compose the so-called Garden Houses. In another type of insula the main source of light is not the street, but an inner arcaded courtyard.
The internal space was not always delimited by a portico; the Insula of the Paintings, comprising the houses of Jove and Ganymede, of the Infant Bacchus and of the Paintings, arranged according to an L-shaped plan, had its façade facing onto two streets, forming a corner, while its inner sides faced onto a fairly extensive garden, without porticoes.
In the 3rdand 4thcenturies, the tenement houses of the less well-to-do fell into ruin or were patched up. Private building seemed limited to the erection of new patrician domus (e.g. the House of Amor and Psyche), built on the ground floor of already existing buildings and richly decorated with costly marbles. In these houses the gardens were chiefly an ornamental backdrop.
The internal garden of the house at Ostia described by St. Augustine (Confessions 9.10.23), which forms the setting for the conversation with his mother St. Monica in A.D. 388, is precisely of this type: a decorative backdrop that enhanced the peace and quiet of the interior of the house, an antithesis to the frenetic but vain life of the city outside.
Ostia gives us, all things considered, the idea of a heavily built-up city, which sacrificed much of its greenery in the attempt to exploit building land as intensively as possible. This must have been the case especially in the most intensive building phase in its history (1st-3rdcentury A.D.). As a consequence, the gardens laid out before this period were in large part destroyed by subsequent building activity. Later garden layouts, on the other hand, were wiped out by the frantic campaign of excavation in the years 1938-1942, conducted in preparation for the World Exhibition, never held due to the outbreak of the Second World War. But today, thanks to the new excavations being conducted at Ostia by Italian and international research groups, using the most modern methods of investigation, the gardens of the ancient city are finally being recovered. In all the cases so far ascertained, they were gardens laid out within peristyles/courtyards, associated with wells or fountains for irrigation. In some cases, the excavators found the classic perforated vases, in others large fragments of terracotta containers. As regards garden furniture, only the Domus of Fortuna Annonaria provided some reliable data.
Ostia in ancient times, however, must have been a good deal greener and richer in vegetation and flora than now seems the case; the ancient sources in fact speak of the flourishing cultivation of vegetables, leaks, melons and salads in Ostian territory. In the 5thcentury A.D. “the Isola Sacra is so lush and pleasant that it does not lack admirable grazing land, neither in the summer, nor in the winter months; in the spring, moreover, it is filled with such a profusion of roses and other flowers that it may be called, for its luscious flowering fragrance, the Lebanon of bountiful Venus” (Cosmographia: 25.25-30).
Garden Garden beneath the House of the Fishes (Domus dei Pesci)
Keywords basins (vessels) water supply systems Garden Description In the course of recent excavations in a room (a) of this house a probable garden area was uncovered (Fig. 1). Only its southern limits, represented by the perimeter wall of an otherwise unidentified building, could be traced. The archaeological sequence established by the stratigraphy of this garden area dates it between the early 2nd and early 3rd century AD. It is characterized by a series of superimposed levels of beaten earth, interrupted by small channels, postholes and larger pits.
One significant level of these successive transformations of the area is represented by a layer which was cut to provide the support for a kind of rectangular terracotta container. It rested directly on the earth, and was perhaps used as a watering basin. Probably connected with this object is a small channel running parallel to it, 10 cm deep and 30 cm wide, paved with pottery fragments. To the south of this channel a pit was located, its edge lined with pottery fragments. It is flanked by two smaller and shallower holes (respectively 12 and 16 cm in diameter), perhaps for small shrubs or poles. Probably slightly later is another layout of the garden, represented by a beaten earth level cut by a pit (c.22 cm wide, 10 cm deep). Found embedded inside it was a large, upturned upper part of a Dressel 20 amphora, possibly used as a planting pot.

Garden Garden Houses (Case a Giardino)
Keywords fountains mosaics (visual works) statues Garden Description The area in which these houses are situated was laid out as a residential area in c.128 AD as part of the Hadrianic remodeling of Ostia (Fig. 1). It is delimited by buildings of various depths, due to the irregularity of the available space. The central area is occupied by two blocks each comprising four houses, surrounded, according to the excavators, by a garden furnished with six fountains (a) (three on the west and three on the east side; they each measure 2.93x3.55 m. and have a maximum preserved height of 75 cm.) (Figs. 2, 3). The fountains had more than a purely decorative function. They seem rather to be the classic type of canopied fountain. Each was equipped with a water spout and probably with an opening for drawing water. The fountains were surrounded on three sides by a travertine border, in which a little channel for the discharge of excess water was hewn. Two rounded grooves in the channel, in front of each spout, have been interpreted as supports for vessels to rest in as they were filled with water. On the fourth side, which has no border, is an outlet for the discharge of water, which flowed into the main drain leading outside the complex.
A fourth fountain (b) was added on the eastern side, in the early years of the 3rd century AD. Its floor was embellished with a mosaic representing Nilotic scenes (3.30x2.96 m) (Fig. 4); it has been suggested that it was roofed with a pergola supported by small columns. This fountain was essentially ornamental. It would have provided jeux d’eau and was perhaps combined with small flower-beds or garden sculptures in the area surrounded by the mosaic border.
A sculptural group with a fishing scene, which could be interpreted as a fountain-head, was found (not in situ) in one of the rooms of the eastern block and might have belonged to this fountain (Fig. 5).

In the 5thcentury A.D. “the Isola Sacra is so lush and pleasant that it does not lack admirable grazing land, neither in the summer, nor in the winter months; in the spring, moreover, it is filled with such a profusion of roses and other flowers that it may be called, for its luscious flowering fragrance, the Lebanon of bountiful Venus” (Cosmographia: 25.25-30).
Garden House of Amor and Psyche
Keywords basins (vessels) columns (architectural elements) mosaics (visual works) nymphaea (garden structures) porticoes viridarium Garden Description The entrance of this house (Fig. 1) (which takes its name from the statuary group found in room b) provides access to a large portico (a) with four columns on marble bases, resting on a continuous marble-paneled balustrade 50 cm high. To the right of the portico was an area believed to be a garden (viridarium) (c) terminating in a nymphaeum. This consisted of a podium 1.10 m. high, paneled in white marble. Hewn into its front side are five deep circular niches. Four are paneled in white marble; only the central niche is panelled in green cipollino marble. The architectural elevation of the nymphaeum rises from this podium (Fig. 2). Over four meters high, it consists of two rectangular alternating with three semicircular niches, framed by six marble columns with Corinthian capitals and rectangular travertine plinths, from which little brick arches project. Five marble stepped gradients were placed between the bases of the columns. They formed miniature cascades: the water piped in by the lead conduit that ran along the bases of the niches flowed down over them. The water filled small rectangular basins and, flowing through terracotta channels inside the podium, spouted from four outlets placed between the niches. The whole of the podium together with the stepped cascades was paneled in white marble and green cipollino; the upper part, by contrast, was stuccoed and adorned with a polychrome wall mosaic. A tile-covered drain ran through the entire length of the podium.
The viridarium is the main source of light for all the rooms that face on it, including the large reception room (d) (Fig. 3). The house is a typical example of an Ostian patrician house of the early 4th century AD.

Location Description DESCRIPTION
Ostia Antica, the port-city of Rome, was situated at the mouth (ostium) of the Tiber, where it flowed into the Tyrrhenian sea. Rome was situated further upriver, several kilometres from the sea. By its maritime position, Ostia also protected the landing at the mouth of the river; it controlled the trade that ran along it, and also the production of salt in the nearby salt works. Ancient historians believed that the city had been founded in the 7thcentury by king Ancus Marcius; archaeological evidence shows that the first settlement was founded as a colonia maritima in the 4thcentury B.C. and that it was already acting as the harbour of Rome in the 3rdcentury B.C.
From the 2ndcentury B.C. Ostia (and later Portus) was the main port for the landing of wheat and other foodstuffs destined for the markets of Rome. It was a lively and cosmopolitan port city, where the great cargo ships unloaded produce from all over the Mediterranean and beyond. At Ostia the freight was transferred to riverboats to be sent upriver to Rome. This thriving commercial activity was accompanied by demographic and economic growth and by the presence of people coming from all over the known world.
Ostia is especially well known in archaeological and historical studies for its building history. The earliest Ostian houses are only known from sporadic traces, beginning from the 2nd century B.C. They were domus of traditional type, both in the simplest version, of direct Italic derivation, with rooms arranged round the atrium, and in the more complex Roman-Hellenistic form, in which the peristyle with the garden was added (e.g. the House of the Bucrania). They were single-family houses, generally single storied, or with an upper story limited to the height of the atrium.
The transition to a different type of house was marked by the so-called peristyle house, such as the House on the Via del Tempio Rotondo, which dates to the Augustan period, the one found below the Schola of Trajan (built A.D. 20-40) and the House of the Thunderbolt, datable to the Vespasianic period (A.D. 69-79). In this latter type of house the rooms are laid out around a small central colonnaded courtyard, sometimes provided with a garden, more often paved. The later examples of this type include the first phase of the House of Fortuna Annonaria, with its garden (AD 140-190).
Ostia was heavily reconstructed in the 2ndcentury A.D., under the pressure of the growth in population due to the completion of its ports. The new city followed new canons of utilitarian, high-density building, based on the multi-storied insula, which aimed at the efficient use of the little space available. A room with windows on the façade became a kind of atrium-room. The plan became enriched with smaller rooms and internal staircases that ascended to the private apartments of the upper floor. Independent stairways entered from the street provided access to the apartments on the second and upper floors. The most accomplished examples of this type of building date to the Hadrianic period, for example in some insulae that compose the so-called Garden Houses. In another type of insula the main source of light is not the street, but an inner arcaded courtyard.
The internal space was not always delimited by a portico; the Insula of the Paintings, comprising the houses of Jove and Ganymede, of the Infant Bacchus and of the Paintings, arranged according to an L-shaped plan, had its façade facing onto two streets, forming a corner, while its inner sides faced onto a fairly extensive garden, without porticoes.
In the 3rdand 4thcenturies, the tenement houses of the less well-to-do fell into ruin or were patched up. Private building seemed limited to the erection of new patrician domus (e.g. the House of Amor and Psyche), built on the ground floor of already existing buildings and richly decorated with costly marbles. In these houses the gardens were chiefly an ornamental backdrop.
The internal garden of the house at Ostia described by St. Augustine (Confessions 9.10.23), which forms the setting for the conversation with his mother St. Monica in A.D. 388, is precisely of this type: a decorative backdrop that enhanced the peace and quiet of the interior of the house, an antithesis to the frenetic but vain life of the city outside.
Ostia gives us, all things considered, the idea of a heavily built-up city, which sacrificed much of its greenery in the attempt to exploit building land as intensively as possible. This must have been the case especially in the most intensive building phase in its history (1st-3rdcentury A.D.). As a consequence, the gardens laid out before this period were in large part destroyed by subsequent building activity. Later garden layouts, on the other hand, were wiped out by the frantic campaign of excavation in the years 1938-1942, conducted in preparation for the World Exhibition, never held due to the outbreak of the Second World War. But today, thanks to the new excavations being conducted at Ostia by Italian and international research groups, using the most modern methods of investigation, the gardens of the ancient city are finally being recovered. In all the cases so far ascertained, they were gardens laid out within peristyles/courtyards, associated with wells or fountains for irrigation. In some cases, the excavators found the classic perforated vases, in others large fragments of terracotta containers. As regards garden furniture, only the Domus of Fortuna Annonaria provided some reliable data.
Ostia in ancient times, however, must have been a good deal greener and richer in vegetation and flora than now seems the case; the ancient sources in fact speak of the flourishing cultivation of vegetables, leaks, melons and salads in Ostian territory. In the 5thcentury A.D. “the Isola Sacra is so lush and pleasant that it does not lack admirable grazing land, neither in the summer, nor in the winter months; in the spring, moreover, it is filled with such a profusion of roses and other flowers that it may be called, for its luscious flowering fragrance, the Lebanon of bountiful Venus” (Cosmographia: 25.25-30).
Garden House of the Bucrania
Keywords domus hortus mosaics (visual works) opus signinum porticoes tesserae Garden Description In the summer 2002 part of the hortus of the Domus with peristyle was excavated (in the west corner) (Fig. 1, d). At 80 cm under the present sea level, part of the garden of a Late Republican domus (called Domus with Bucrania) was revealed. The domus was built about 80-60 BC and destroyed about 20-40 AD. A dark organic soil layer was found, at the same level as the floors of the building. A flower pot with four holes was found in this layer. The foundation of a low wall and several structures composed of splinters of tuff bound by bad quality mortar were probably part of the internal arrangement of the garden. Future excavation will certainly help to understand better these structures; the study of pollens and seeds is also in progress.
After the demolition of the House with Bucrania, the resulting consistent layer of debris was used to raise the ground level on which the House with Peristyle was going to be built, thus obliterating the garden. This layer was composed, among other finds, of a considerable number of painted plaster and stucco fragments of excellent quality that have made a reconstruction of the aspect of this area possible. There was a portico with brick columns, plastered and painted purple on the smooth socle, modelled with large flutings and painted white in the upper part; the portico was paved in opus signinum with inserted mosaic tesserae and chips of marble; its walls were painted in the second Pompeian style: large violet orthostats were delimited by brown fluted columns, surmounted by Doric capitals on which large green garlands with birds hung; above this there was a complex network of green and red header blocks and a frieze of yellow palm leaf on a violet ground. The ceiling was violet with an overpainted geometrical pattern. The architrave of the portico, open on the garden, was probably decorated by terracotta architectural plaques and a feline waterspout.
At present, this is the earliest hortus known in ancient Ostia.

Garden House of the Fortuna Annonaria
Keywords basins (vessels) columns (architectural elements) mosaics (visual works) nymphaea (garden structures) oeci opus listatum peristyles (Roman courtyards) statues Garden Description The peristyle garden (Fig. 1, a) has travertine columns on three sides. The fourth side coincides with the perimeter wall of the house, which forms part of the original plan, dating to the 2nd century AD. The last phase of the domus, lavishly decorated with precious marbles, dates to the 4th century AD. Against the rear wall of the garden is a brick niche (h. 194 cm.; w. 114 cm.) containing a statue of Juno or Demeter and two benches in opus listatum (w. 41 cm.; preserved h. 28 cm.). “The area inside the peristyle must undoubtedly have been kept as a garden (Figs. 2 and 3). The remains of a rectangular basin (3.10x5.40 m.) with drainage outlet at its north-east corner were found at its center” (Becatti).
There is a well (diam. 49 cm.) in the eastern part of the garden; it is adorned with a marble well-head decorated with bucrania in neo-attic style, dating to the 2nd century AD (dia. 66 cm; h. 55 cm) (Fig. 4). Two small herms also formed part of the garden decoration.
A large female statue was found in situ on its pedestal, adhering to the end-wall of the western portico of the peristyle. Endowed with the attributes of trade (cornucopia and oar), the female figure has been identified as Fortuna Annonaria, the personification of Ostia’s trading success.
The large apsidal reception room (oecus) (Fig. 1, b), with two columns marking its entrance, was located in the western part of the house. The garden, with flowering plants, onto which it opens, formed its natural continuation. This, together with the nymphaeum that decorated the south side of the room, its rear wall articulated with alternating semicircular and rectangular niches containing statues, provided a suitably splendid and prestige-enhancing setting for the public life of the owner, probably a wealthy trader.
The garden also forms the backdrop to the rooms in the east part of the house, a triclinium (Fig. 1, c) and a heated cubicle (Fig. 1, d), lit by a large window and decorated with a lavish black and white mosaic floor with mythological scenes.

Garden House of the Thunderbold (Domus Fulminata)
Keywords biclinia columns (architectural elements) domus lararia peristyles (Roman courtyards) tesserae Garden Description The peristyle garden, excavated in 1941, was surrounded by a portico on all four sides, supported by brick columns, some of which were paired or clustered in threes (Fig. 1). In the original building, dating to the Flavian period, the garden (a) was furnished with a brick biclinium, with the klinai placed opposite each other. Behind the klinai was an aedicula-shaped lararium with a cylindrical marble altar in front of it (Fig. 2). On the opposite side, and aligned with the entrance, was the basin of a fountain with a polychrome mosaic in blue and yellow tesserae (built in a second phase, c. 150-200 AD). It was probably fed by the lead pipe (stamped SEXTILIUS SECUNDUS FECIT) that was seen by the excavators leading from the entrance towards the Decumanus. A well-head, placed at the entrance to the garden, had a purely ornamental function, since its bottom is sealed and it only has a hole for the runoff of water. A cube-shaped stuccoed brick pedestal was erected at the southwest corner of the peristyle. Into its sloping top was inserted a marble plaque, inscribed with the letters FDC (“fulgur dium conditum”). It marked the spot where lightning had struck, as well as things that had been struck by the same lightning bolt and ritually buried to placate the wrath of the gods.
The residential rooms of the domus were placed on its upper floor. Some experts think that the main reception rooms should be identified in the wing facing onto the northwest side of the garden. However, not everyone agrees that the House of the Thunderbolt was a private residential building. It could also have been the site of a college or corporation, which some archaeologists connect with the nearby sanctuary of the Bona Dea. The rooms aligned along the eastern side, all intercommunicating, would have been, in this case, the ceremonial rooms of the college, whereas the residential sector of the building would be identifiable in the rooms on the western side.
The house is one of the most interesting examples of the transition from the atrium peristyle house of Republican tradition to the house with a colonnaded courtyard typical of Ostian residential architecture in the 2ndcentury AD.

Ostia Antica, the port-city of Rome, was situated at the mouth (ostium) of the Tiber, where it flowed into the Tyrrhenian sea. Rome was situated further upriver, several kilometres from the sea. By its maritime position, Ostia also protected the landing at the mouth of the river; it controlled the trade that ran along it, and also the production of salt in the nearby salt works. Ancient historians believed that the city had been founded in the 7thcentury by king Ancus Marcius; archaeological evidence shows that the first settlement was founded as a colonia maritima in the 4thcentury B.C. and that it was already acting as the harbour of Rome in the 3rdcentury B.C.
From the 2ndcentury B.C. Ostia (and later Portus) was the main port for the landing of wheat and other foodstuffs destined for the markets of Rome. It was a lively and cosmopolitan port city, where the great cargo ships unloaded produce from all over the Mediterranean and beyond. At Ostia the freight was transferred to riverboats to be sent upriver to Rome. This thriving commercial activity was accompanied by demographic and economic growth and by the presence of people coming from all over the known world.
Ostia is especially well known in archaeological and historical studies for its building history. The earliest Ostian houses are only known from sporadic traces, beginning from the 2nd century B.C. They were domus of traditional type, both in the simplest version, of direct Italic derivation, with rooms arranged round the atrium, and in the more complex Roman-Hellenistic form, in which the peristyle with the garden was added (e.g. the House of the Bucrania). They were single-family houses, generally single storied, or with an upper story limited to the height of the atrium.
The transition to a different type of house was marked by the so-called peristyle house, such as the House on the Via del Tempio Rotondo, which dates to the Augustan period, the one found below the Schola of Trajan (built A.D. 20-40) and the House of the Thunderbolt, datable to the Vespasianic period (A.D. 69-79). In this latter type of house the rooms are laid out around a small central colonnaded courtyard, sometimes provided with a garden, more often paved. The later examples of this type include the first phase of the House of Fortuna Annonaria, with its garden (AD 140-190).
Ostia was heavily reconstructed in the 2ndcentury A.D., under the pressure of the growth in population due to the completion of its ports. The new city followed new canons of utilitarian, high-density building, based on the multi-storied insula, which aimed at the efficient use of the little space available. A room with windows on the façade became a kind of atrium-room. The plan became enriched with smaller rooms and internal staircases that ascended to the private apartments of the upper floor. Independent stairways entered from the street provided access to the apartments on the second and upper floors. The most accomplished examples of this type of building date to the Hadrianic period, for example in some insulae that compose the so-called Garden Houses. In another type of insula the main source of light is not the street, but an inner arcaded courtyard.
The internal space was not always delimited by a portico; the Insula of the Paintings, comprising the houses of Jove and Ganymede, of the Infant Bacchus and of the Paintings, arranged according to an L-shaped plan, had its façade facing onto two streets, forming a corner, while its inner sides faced onto a fairly extensive garden, without porticoes.
In the 3rdand 4thcenturies, the tenement houses of the less well-to-do fell into ruin or were patched up. Private building seemed limited to the erection of new patrician domus (e.g. the House of Amor and Psyche), built on the ground floor of already existing buildings and richly decorated with costly marbles. In these houses the gardens were chiefly an ornamental backdrop.
The internal garden of the house at Ostia described by St. Augustine (Confessions 9.10.23), which forms the setting for the conversation with his mother St. Monica in A.D. 388, is precisely of this type: a decorative backdrop that enhanced the peace and quiet of the interior of the house, an antithesis to the frenetic but vain life of the city outside.
Ostia gives us, all things considered, the idea of a heavily built-up city, which sacrificed much of its greenery in the attempt to exploit building land as intensively as possible. This must have been the case especially in the most intensive building phase in its history (1st-3rdcentury A.D.). As a consequence, the gardens laid out before this period were in large part destroyed by subsequent building activity. Later garden layouts, on the other hand, were wiped out by the frantic campaign of excavation in the years 1938-1942, conducted in preparation for the World Exhibition, never held due to the outbreak of the Second World War. But today, thanks to the new excavations being conducted at Ostia by Italian and international research groups, using the most modern methods of investigation, the gardens of the ancient city are finally being recovered. In all the cases so far ascertained, they were gardens laid out within peristyles/courtyards, associated with wells or fountains for irrigation. In some cases, the excavators found the classic perforated vases, in others large fragments of terracotta containers. As regards garden furniture, only the Domus of Fortuna Annonaria provided some reliable data.
Ostia in ancient times, however, must have been a good deal greener and richer in vegetation and flora than now seems the case; the ancient sources in fact speak of the flourishing cultivation of vegetables, leaks, melons and salads in Ostian territory. In the 5thcentury A.D. “the Isola Sacra is so lush and pleasant that it does not lack admirable grazing land, neither in the summer, nor in the winter months; in the spring, moreover, it is filled with such a profusion of roses and other flowers that it may be called, for its luscious flowering fragrance, the Lebanon of bountiful Venus” (Cosmographia: 25.25-30).
Garden House on Via del Tempio Rotundo
Keywords basins (vessels) fountains opus signinum peristyles (Roman courtyards) vases Garden Description This house was only partially excavated between June 1972 and January 1973 (Fig. 1). In its Augustan phase the peristyle garden (a) was adorned with a large central basin paved in opus signinum. At the center of the basin was a brick support, interpreted as the base of a fountain. The columns of the peristyle, probably Tuscan, rested on bases alternating with travertine strips at pavement level (Fig. 2). Three perforated vases of the type of ollae perforatae recorded by Cato (RR 52, 133) and Pliny (NH 12. 16; 17. 64, 97) were found between the basin and the columns of the peristyle, and exactly aligned with their bases. The ollae were intact and must have contained plants, no doubt of the flowering and rambling variety, which would have found both a support and a chromatic backdrop in the columns to the rear.

Garden House with Peristyle
Keywords courtyards porticoes water supply systems Garden Description During the winter 1938-1939 part of an earlier building was found under the occupation level of the Schola of the Trajan. It was called House with peristyle, as the main preserved feature was seen to be the considerable part of a classical peristyle (Fig. 1, b). The house was erected between 20-40 AD and then destroyed between 160-200 AD. The find created great interest and massive restorations began, in order to show visitors a characteristic type of private architecture of the early Empire, rarely found in Ostia.
The portico of this house was then partially rebuilt with brick columns (Fig. 2). On its east, roofed side, the portico is paved with a white and black tessellated mosaic with geometrical and vegetal decorations. Some of the wall painting is conserved in situ on the east wall of the portico. It is also possible to date several later restorations of the house between the 1st and the 2nd century AD.
The portico courtyard was a garden. On its northern side was a large rectangular nymphaeum, also restored in 1939. It is decorated with a semi-circular niche on its long southern side. The floor is paved in opus spicatum; the walls are lined with hydraulic mortar, painted blue (Fig. 1, c). The volume of this nymphaeum and the system of the water evacuation and supply were modified several times. The well in opus testaceum, in the angle southwest of the basin, is certainly one of the latest features. There is another well under the east corner of the portico that can be reached by stairs. The underground space, which was created around the well, could have been used as a cellar.

Garden Piazzale della Corporazioni The Forum of Corporations (Pleiades)
Keywords basins (vessels) columns (architectural elements) opus signinum porticoes statues Garden Description In the original plan of the Augustan period the garden area to the back of the theater was surrounded on three sides by a roofed corridor opening onto the Tiber on the northern side with a monumental entrance. In the Claudian period the whole level of the area was raised and a portico consisting of a single row of brick columns added. A temple was built at the center of the garden area in the Domitianic period; traditionally identified since its discovery (1881) with the temple of Ceres, it has more recently been attributed to Vulcan or to the imperial cult. During the Hadrianic period the portico was doubled with a second row of columns; the entrances on the northern side were blocked, and buildings erected against them, making access to the garden possible only from the theater (Fig. 1).
The open area to the back of the theater was never built over. Laid out as a garden, and adorned with statues raised in honor of men who had distinguished themselves in trade, it conformed to the recommendation of Vitruvius (5.9.1,5), that areas surrounding a theater be laid out with colonnades (post scaenam porticus) and embellished with gardens, where people could stroll about and converse. During the excavations of Rodolfo Lanciani (1881) “a street traversing the excavated area of the Forum and aligned on the axis of the temple and the theatre” was identified. Reported to be “gravelled and edged with marble borders”, this street was probably a path of the garden that led from the theater to the temple at the center of the area: “The Forum of Ceres &amp;hellip; was once ornamented with a garden, the allées of which can still be traced with the help of the marble border-lines by which each plot of green was defined and surrounded.”
During the excavations of Dante Vaglieri (1910-1913), a system of conduits was identified. It was linked to a large sewer that ran underground at the center of the garden area, sloping downwards from south to north in the direction of the Tiber. Two conduits parallel to the central sewer ran in front of the stationes. At garden level there were two long gutters that collected rainwater from the roof of the portico. Two basins (respectively 3.10x2.90 and 3.45x3.35 m) at ground level were identified on the southern side of the garden; they were paved with opus signinum on the inside and probably panelled in marble.
In October 1912 Dante Vaglieri began the reconstruction of the garden at the center of the Piazzale delle Corporazioni (Fig. 2). He commissioned a famous landscape architect of the period to create a garden with rectangular parterres of various size which retraced in part the layout of the allées and flower-beds of the ancient garden: “This garden, reconstructed by one of our cleverest landscape artists, with its display of classic bushes and flowers, its colonnade lining the four sides 4of the square, and its array of statues of eminent men, bankers, merchants, magistrates, harbour-masters, &amp;amp;c., has become the chief attraction to the visitors of Ostia…” The leading experts in garden architecture of the period included Nicodemo Severi and Giuseppe Roda: perhaps one of them was the “cleverest landscape artist.”

Ostia in ancient times, however, must have been a good deal greener and richer in vegetation and flora than now seems the case; the ancient sources in fact speak of the flourishing cultivation of vegetables, leaks, melons and salads in Ostian territory. In the 5thcentury A.D. “the Isola Sacra is so lush and pleasant that it does not lack admirable grazing land, neither in the summer, nor in the winter months; in the spring, moreover, it is filled with such a profusion of roses and other flowers that it may be called, for its luscious flowering fragrance, the Lebanon of bountiful Venus” (Cosmographia: 25.25-30).
Garden Schola of Trajan
Keywords courtyards porticoes water supply systems Garden Description The monumental complex of the Schola of the Trajan, presumed headquarters of the corporation of the marine carpenters, was built c.160-200 and abandoned after the 4th century CE. It was excavated and restored during the winter of 1938-1939. It includes a vast internal courtyard, which is oblong and marked with an obtuse angle in its median part (Fig. 1, a). Unfortunately, ancient damage and early, inaccurate excavations make it impossible to know if this space was paved or a garden.
An Ionic portico, with a colonnade of bricks with stucco, surrounded this internal space. A long and narrow water channel crossed the peristyle court of the Schola in all its length. It had a low parapet, decorated on its internal face by a row of rounded niches, and was faced with marble (much restored) (Fig. 2). Slightly offset, the particular position of this channel provokes a subtle optical correction of the angle, which marks the plan of the building. The channel was reduced, or perhaps even abandoned during the construction of the receding part of the Schola. New excavations since 1998 in the Northern sector of the peristyle court have uncovered an important part of the plumbing network. It must have been used for the water supply of this internal space of the Schola, which was probably rich in jeux d’eau.

Location Ostia (Pleiades)
Location Description DESCRIPTION
Ostia Antica, the port-city of Rome, was situated at the mouth (ostium) of the Tiber, where it flowed into the Tyrrhenian sea. Rome was situated further upriver, several kilometres from the sea. By its maritime position, Ostia also protected the landing at the mouth of the river; it controlled the trade that ran along it, and also the production of salt in the nearby salt works. Ancient historians believed that the city had been founded in the 7thcentury by king Ancus Marcius; archaeological evidence shows that the first settlement was founded as a colonia maritima in the 4thcentury B.C. and that it was already acting as the harbour of Rome in the 3rdcentury B.C.
From the 2ndcentury B.C. Ostia (and later Portus) was the main port for the landing of wheat and other foodstuffs destined for the markets of Rome. It was a lively and cosmopolitan port city, where the great cargo ships unloaded produce from all over the Mediterranean and beyond. At Ostia the freight was transferred to riverboats to be sent upriver to Rome. This thriving commercial activity was accompanied by demographic and economic growth and by the presence of people coming from all over the known world.
Ostia is especially well known in archaeological and historical studies for its building history. The earliest Ostian houses are only known from sporadic traces, beginning from the 2nd century B.C. They were domus of traditional type, both in the simplest version, of direct Italic derivation, with rooms arranged round the atrium, and in the more complex Roman-Hellenistic form, in which the peristyle with the garden was added (e.g. the House of the Bucrania). They were single-family houses, generally single storied, or with an upper story limited to the height of the atrium.
The transition to a different type of house was marked by the so-called peristyle house, such as the House on the Via del Tempio Rotondo, which dates to the Augustan period, the one found below the Schola of Trajan (built A.D. 20-40) and the House of the Thunderbolt, datable to the Vespasianic period (A.D. 69-79). In this latter type of house the rooms are laid out around a small central colonnaded courtyard, sometimes provided with a garden, more often paved. The later examples of this type include the first phase of the House of Fortuna Annonaria, with its garden (AD 140-190).
Ostia was heavily reconstructed in the 2ndcentury A.D., under the pressure of the growth in population due to the completion of its ports. The new city followed new canons of utilitarian, high-density building, based on the multi-storied insula, which aimed at the efficient use of the little space available. A room with windows on the façade became a kind of atrium-room. The plan became enriched with smaller rooms and internal staircases that ascended to the private apartments of the upper floor. Independent stairways entered from the street provided access to the apartments on the second and upper floors. The most accomplished examples of this type of building date to the Hadrianic period, for example in some insulae that compose the so-called Garden Houses. In another type of insula the main source of light is not the street, but an inner arcaded courtyard.
The internal space was not always delimited by a portico; the Insula of the Paintings, comprising the houses of Jove and Ganymede, of the Infant Bacchus and of the Paintings, arranged according to an L-shaped plan, had its façade facing onto two streets, forming a corner, while its inner sides faced onto a fairly extensive garden, without porticoes.
In the 3rdand 4thcenturies, the tenement houses of the less well-to-do fell into ruin or were patched up. Private building seemed limited to the erection of new patrician domus (e.g. the House of Amor and Psyche), built on the ground floor of already existing buildings and richly decorated with costly marbles. In these houses the gardens were chiefly an ornamental backdrop.
The internal garden of the house at Ostia described by St. Augustine (Confessions 9.10.23), which forms the setting for the conversation with his mother St. Monica in A.D. 388, is precisely of this type: a decorative backdrop that enhanced the peace and quiet of the interior of the house, an antithesis to the frenetic but vain life of the city outside.
Ostia gives us, all things considered, the idea of a heavily built-up city, which sacrificed much of its greenery in the attempt to exploit building land as intensively as possible. This must have been the case especially in the most intensive building phase in its history (1st-3rdcentury A.D.). As a consequence, the gardens laid out before this period were in large part destroyed by subsequent building activity. Later garden layouts, on the other hand, were wiped out by the frantic campaign of excavation in the years 1938-1942, conducted in preparation for the World Exhibition, never held due to the outbreak of the Second World War. But today, thanks to the new excavations being conducted at Ostia by Italian and international research groups, using the most modern methods of investigation, the gardens of the ancient city are finally being recovered. In all the cases so far ascertained, they were gardens laid out within peristyles/courtyards, associated with wells or fountains for irrigation. In some cases, the excavators found the classic perforated vases, in others large fragments of terracotta containers. As regards garden furniture, only the Domus of Fortuna Annonaria provided some reliable data.
Ostia in ancient times, however, must have been a good deal greener and richer in vegetation and flora than now seems the case; the ancient sources in fact speak of the flourishing cultivation of vegetables, leaks, melons and salads in Ostian territory. In the 5thcentury A.D. “the Isola Sacra is so lush and pleasant that it does not lack admirable grazing land, neither in the summer, nor in the winter months; in the spring, moreover, it is filled with such a profusion of roses and other flowers that it may be called, for its luscious flowering fragrance, the Lebanon of bountiful Venus” (Cosmographia: 25.25-30).
Garden Insula dei Dipinti
Keywords aedicules flowerpots insulae mosaics (visual works) Garden Description The large open area in this insula, divided into two by a wall, was identified as a garden at the time of excavation (1914 to 1919), but on little evidence apart from the absence of paving over most of the area. Recent excavations have however clarified the phases of the garden and added some significant detail. The garden is now known to have been created as a single area, forming an integral part of the late Hadrianic development comprising the three houses which make up the Insula of the Paintings (House of Jove and Ganymede, House of the Infant Bacchus and House of the Paintings). The excavations in the SW corner of the south garden (Fig. 1, Tr. 1) however produced no evidence of Hadrianic garden features, due to the garden being greatly disturbed by a substantial restoration of the insula somewhere in the period AD 150-180. At this time the wall dividing the garden into two was built, and a humus-rich soil imported into the south garden area, its use as a garden being confirmed by fragments of five flower pots, recognized by the holes in their bases. In addition, the lower part of a Dressel 20 amphora and a neat, sub-triangular pit roughly 50 cm across cut into the underlying rubble fill may have served as planters. In the Severan period a small aedicular shrine was added to the south face of the new garden wall, the niche being originally decorated with glass mosaic above foliage plants against a red ground. This was later covered with whitewash and replaced by a figured scene, and finally a statue of Jove was installed in the niche. A section of black-and-white geometric mosaic, overlying the humus-rich soil in Trench 1 and possibly associated lightweight rough walls, suggests the creation of a summer pavilion or dining room during this period, which would have enjoyed a view of the garden shrine.

Keywords aqueducts cisterns (plumbing components) nemus (grove) niches (architectural elements) nymphaea (garden structures) porticoes planting beds stagnum (man-made lake) temples (buildings) Garden Description The Temple of the Divine Claudius, located on the northern slope of the Caelian Hill, was constructed in multiple phases. The temple is known from the Severan marble plan (FUR) (Fig. 1) and from archaeological remains. Agrippina initiated the building of the temple but was murdered before its completion. After the fire of 64 CE, Nero altered the temple to include it in the Domus Aurea (Seutonius Vesp. 9; Frontinus Aq. 2.76). Vespasian completed the temple in 69 CE.
The temple is located on top of a platform (180 x 210 m.) and is situated just off-center to the east. During Nero&amp;rsquo;s reign, the platform upon which the temple stood was converted into a nymphaeum as part of the Domus Aurea, which the Aqua Claudia supplied. Nero redirected the Aqua Claudia to feed the stagnum of the Domus Aurea. The rectangular and semi-circular niches on the eastern side are best preserved and are visible from the Via Claudia. The space between this façade and the platform wall proper is presumably a passage for water. Vespasian restored the temple and Claudius' divinity in 69 CE and considerably altered the original structure. Fragment 5c of FUR, now existing only as a Renaissance drawing, depicts the temple as a prostyle, pentastyle temple. However, most scholars agree that the temple was probably hexastyle.
Because these remains are located under the present-day Monastery of the Passionist Fathers, no recent excavation has been possible. A. M. Colini’s excavations reveal that the four faces of the platform differ significantly. Under the stairs of the north side was a cistern, presumably remnants of Nero&amp;rsquo;s nymphaeum, the water supply for the temple complex. The south face, as yet unexcavated, should reveal evidence of the Aqua Claudia.
The temple is set within eight L-shaped [planting beds](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300430426 and fourteen rectangular planting beds (Fig. 2). Some scholars considered these forms to be the substructures of the temple complex, while it is also possible that these structures are water features. However, the majority of scholars believe that these structures are planted rows of trees or shrubs in a nemus, similar to the plantings found during the new excavations of the Templum Pacis. The role of Vespasian as sponsor also lends credence to such an interpretation. Vespasian is credited with building a quadriporticus to surround the entire platform and Martial mentions a porticus (Martial Sp. 2.9-10), but there is no evidence for the porticus on the marble plan.

Numidia (Roman province)(Pleiades)
Province Description The frontier between Numidia and Mauretania fluctuated during early the African kingdoms. It was fixed at the river of Ampsaga during Caesar’s reign when he rewarded his ally King Bocchus, giving him part of the Numidian kingdom. By 31 BCE, Numidia (also known as Africa Nova) was under direct Roman control, becoming attached to the province of Africa Proconsularis. Toward 194 CE, Septimus Severus detached most of the Numidia territory from the province of Africa Proconsularis, forming a special province governed from Cirta by a procurator, subordinate to the imperial legate. With the Diocletian reforms, the whole of Roman Africa (with exception of Mauretania Tingitana) constituted a single diocese subdivided into six provinces, including Numidia Cirtensis with Cirta as capital.

###City Plan Fig. 1: Plan of Cuicul Location Description The city of Cuicul, modern Djemila in Algeria, was a Roman colony founded by Trajan at the beginning of the second century. It was located near the western frontier of Numidia, at a crossroads near the High Plain of Setif and quite south of the actual “Little Kabylie” region. The original city center was constructed on a spur set between two merging wadi, the Gergour and the Betame, at an altitude of about eight hundred meters above sea level, surrounded by mountains more than a thousand meters above sea level. There are snow falls and freezing cold in winter and plenty of water. For the most part, the climate exc1udes plants which cannot stand the frost; however, we can infer the presence of olive plantations due to the number of olive presses found throughout the town.
Garden House of Asinus Nica, Central District (Maison de l’Ane, quartier central)
Keywords domus peristyle houses courtyards exedrae (site elements) mosaics (visual works) stairs triclinia (rooms) [bath] [basin] [semicircular basin] Garden Description Like several peristyle houses of the ancient part of Cuicul, the house of Asinus Nica, about 870 square meters in size, was inhabited and transformed from the second to the fifth century. The fifth century additions are the large reception room XI with a marine Venus mosaic and the private baths with the Asinus Nica mosaics. The more ancient part of the house, south of wall M-M’ is rather small and more irregular in shape.
The open area of this peristyle garden, about 9 by 8.5 meters in size, is enclosed by 1 meter-high walls and divided into compartments. Some these were pools, as we can still see hydraulic mortar inside. From the semi-circular pool, a rilled wall brought water to a lower pool, shaped as half a concave octagon. The eastern compartment was a pool that may have been decorated with a water spout, of which only bases remain. It contained a smaller pool, rectangular with two niches. In the western compartment, no mortar was found; it was certainly planted. Four quoining pillars, standing directly on the rock, and eight columns, sitting on low walls, supported the four porticoes that were paved with geometrical mosaics.
The house lacked wide-open views from exedra and from the galleries towards the pools and the gardens. This irregularity can be explained by the presence of a first floor opening directly onto the Cardo Maximus, the existence of which is shown by a staircase with seven steps. A reception room was located on the first floor, so that the enclosed garden and the pools could be seen through windows or galleries from the upper floor. From this elevation, the luxurious decoration and lavish use of water would have been seen to full effect.

Garden House of Bacchus, building south of the Great Baths (Maison de Bacchus, édifice au sud des Grands Thermes)
Keywords amphorae (storage vessels) domus mosaics (visual works) oeci pergolas peristyle houses piscinae statuettes (free-standing sculpture) [fish pool] Garden Description The large block of buildings called the &amp;ldquo;House of Bacchus&amp;rdquo;, (about 7000 m2) has three separated gardens A, B, C and a peristyle VI. This site has been excavated during four periods (1929, 1931,1937 and 1944).
1-The first garden A is a large open area at the north-east corner of the buildings, along the narrow street which separates it from the Great Baths. It could be overlooked from the portico stretching before the great reception hall with seven apses, constructed in the middle of the fifth century. Earlier (second-third century), people could enter it through a door, two steps of which are still visible under the north wall, in front of an underground door of the Great Baths; this garden belonged then to the public baths dedicated in 193 B. C.. At that time, on the western side of this garden, there were little baths excavated under the seven apses room and contemporaneous with the latter.
2-The main building (Plan view Fig. 1) is composed of two peristyle dwellings, formerly separate, linked up during the Late Empire; the central space of the large one was paved, first with slabs, afterwards with mosaic. The little peristyle (7 m x 10 m) was a garden (B) enclosed by three porticoes, supported by six columns (rough and probably stuccoed) and bordered by a low wall. On the south side, there was a semi-circular pool, the front of which was closed by two stone plates, engraved with lozenges and joined by a cut column. The exedra and the rooms having view into the garden seem to have been devoted to private life, unlike the large one.
3-The rear garden (C) of the &amp;ldquo;House of Bacchus&amp;rdquo; seems to have originally belonged to the little baths and then the house with the large peristyle VI (see Plan view in red Fig. 1). It was greatly transformed in Late Antiquity. The great seven apses hall, built in the middle of the fifth century, took the place of the small baths and overwhelmed this space with its impressive volume. The large oecus may be assigned to the Constantinian period: perhaps it had a view over the rear garden at that time. Afterwards, this room was extended with an absidial pool (11 m long); through a wide door, people accessed a little terrace, from where they overlooked the new pool, paved with marble, one meter below. Water arrived from two little pools on each side and went into the drain of the seven apses room. Two little columns bore a small pediment. In the inside edges, we see terracotta amphoras used to raise fish. The inside borders are complete, but the outside masonry is unfinished, so that we may think that the rear wall may have stood high enough to form a nymphaeum. The masonry is similar in the fish pool and in the seven apses (brick tiles joined by brick layers forming crosses) : from that, we infer they were built at the same time, in the middle of the fifth century. The foundation of the fish pool was laid on the bottom of the rectangular one, which perhaps was filled up.

Garden House of Europa, Central District (Maison d&amp;rsquo;Europe, Quartier Central)
Keywords domus exedrae (site elements) mosaics (visual works) peristyle houses piscinae [basin] [fish pool] Garden Description This house of irregular shape (Plan view, Fig. 1), rested against the ancient city wall, transformed into a decorative wall for the Severian Forum, and between two large cardines. It was excavated in 1911.
We can see the complex building of Late Antiquity (1500 m2), centered around the peristyle, with a large central area (8.10 x 7.70 m) (Fig. 1). The bases of the columns (four on each side) are not visible; therefore, they seem to lay on a lower level, hidden by later phase of construction. During the first half of Vth century, low walls were set against the columns, except on the west side, where the open area was entered from the gallery. On the north side, an apse, paved with a mosaic representing a shell, encroaches upon the inner space. On the east side, in front of the large exedra XVIII, a mass of masonry includes three small semi-circular pools. A large rectangular fish pool rests against the mass of masonry; there are little terracotta amphoras inside the edges. At the centre of this pool, rose a tall hexagonal base engraved with an ivy scroll and unreadable inscriptions, standing on a hollow base. The peristyle galleries were paved with mosaics: there were geometric patterns and two inscriptions glorifying the owner Castorius and his family.
The L shaped space between the fish pool and the columns was probably planted.

Numidia (Roman province)(Pleiades)
Province Description The frontier between Numidia and Mauretania fluctuated during early the African kingdoms. It was fixed at the river of Ampsaga during Caesar’s reign when he rewarded his ally King Bocchus, giving him part of the Numidian kingdom. By 31 BCE, Numidia (also known as Africa Nova) was under direct Roman control, becoming attached to the province of Africa Proconsularis. Toward 194 CE, Septimus Severus detached most of the Numidia territory from the province of Africa Proconsularis, forming a special province governed from Cirta by a procurator, subordinate to the imperial legate. With the Diocletian reforms, the whole of Roman Africa (with exception of Mauretania Tingitana) constituted a single diocese subdivided into six provinces, including Numidia Cirtensis with Cirta as capital.

###City Plan Fig. 1: Plan of Cuicul Location Description The city of Cuicul, modern Djemila in Algeria, was a Roman colony founded by Trajan at the beginning of the second century. It was located near the western frontier of Numidia, at a crossroads near the High Plain of Setif and quite south of the actual “Little Kabylie” region. The original city center was constructed on a spur set between two merging wadi, the Gergour and the Betame, at an altitude of about eight hundred meters above sea level, surrounded by mountains more than a thousand meters above sea level. There are snow falls and freezing cold in winter and plenty of water. For the most part, the climate exc1udes plants which cannot stand the frost; however, we can infer the presence of olive plantations due to the number of olive presses found throughout the town.
Garden House of Europa, Central District (Maison d&amp;rsquo;Europe, Quartier Central)
Keywords [bath] domus mosaics (visual works) peristyle houses triclinia (rooms) [baisn] [planters] [pool] Garden Description The block of buildings termed the House of Europa, about 1500 square meters in area, extends along the main Cardo, quite over the north gate of the town. It included large and small baths, a monumental entrance, shops and other areas for commercial use, and a peristyle house on the north side. It was excavated in 1914 and 1915.
Three exedras (Fig. 1, labels 13, 18 and 22) had a large view into the peristyle courtyard (Fig. 2). An open area, limited by the wall I-J and measuring about 10 by 8.4 meters, was enclosed by three porticoes, supported by six columns on the north, five columns and one pilaster on the west and east sides. Around the end of the second century, the area seems to have been paved with cement; rain water went out through a drainage structure at the northwest corner, towards the main drain in the street. At a later period when the house extended to the whole insula, possibly during the fourth or fifth century, three pools were added to the peristyle. In front of the large north exedra, there was a low semicircular pool with small niches inside. At an upper level, a large square pool with niches in the corners almost covered the open central area, about 6 by 5.6 meters in size. On the south side, projecting over the ancient dividing wall I-J, there was a large semi-circular pool, with a small axial recess. On each side, on the southern limit of the square pool, we see a small planter (Fig. 1, labels d and d’), originally at the same height as this pool, about 0.70 m. On each side of the small northern pool, similarly tall plinths probably bore a crater-shaped planting pot or a sculpture, bounded by a low wall to the middle pool.
Room 18 enjoyed a spectacular view toward the terraced fountains and plants. It was paved with mosaics from both the early and late Empire periods, remnants of which have been found. In the fifth century, room 13 was transformed into a triclinium opening towards the west and was paved with a mosaic of Europa.
Above a vaulted cellar (Fig. 1, label IX), probably dating to the second century, a terrace overlooked the peristyle courtyard towards the south. It might have been used as a hanging garden, possibly decorated with potted plants.

On the side of the corridor leading from the Severan Forum, there was a garden, about 11 by 12 meters in size. It was enclosed by a portico on the north and the east sides, with an entrance on the northwest corner. The north gallery, paved with stone slabs and a Hylas mosaic, was supported by four columns standing on a low wall. In the middle of the central intercolumnation, there was a semi-circular pool. The site is dated between the end of the fourth and the fifth centuries.

Garden House of Hylas, Central District (Maison de Castorius, Quartier central)
Keywords mosaics (visual works) piscinae porticoes pergolas [bath] [sculpture] [diaeta] Garden Description The garden A mentioned as an open area was excavated in 1930-1931 and in 1944 (Plan view, Fig. 1). It was enclosed on the N, by the Small Baths I (covered in a later period by the seven apse hall built in the fifth century); on the W, by the limit of a long boundary wall (44m long) of the property; on the S, by another wall and by the little building II with the well known dionysiac pavement. Along the rear wall of the garden on the W, there was a terrace III (9 m long) paved with black mosaic. It runs from the large reservoir at the SW corner to a pavilion IV near the NW corner. The pavilion (6.40 m x 3.60 m) commanded a large view over the garden; it may be interpreted as a summer dining room, a diaeta. It was decorated with stuccoed moldings and a colorful mosaic pavement, which could hardly be dated before the fourth century, but perhaps was not the original pavement. Parallel to the edge of the terrace, one meter below the reservoir, sixty centimeters below the terrace, there was a rectangular pool V (16. 50 m X 4.50 m, 1.63 m deep). Water entered at the south edge, under the pedestal (a) still in place. Along the W and the S sides of the pool, more or less than two meters away, there is a row of stone bases, each showing a hole for a wood post, that likely supported a pergola; a vine probably shaded the passage (similar holes are visible in the N and W edges of the pool) (fig. 2, fig. 3). Standing on the pedestal (a), we may imagine a garden statue, for the feet of a marble statuette of an Unraveling Venus (1 m high) were found precisely at the same time (fig. 4) ; the body had been carried, by the load of earth along the sharp slope, towards the large peristyle. Near the pool were also found a broken head of Aseculapius (30 cm high) and a set of surgical instruments. On the E side of the garden, there was a tank that stored water from the spring, the channel of which crosses the garden towards the large peristyle VI. The little building II with dionysiac pavement, perhaps widely opened towards the garden, and must be interpreted in connection to it: the vine in the mosaic may recall the vine in the pergola. This ornamental garden combines many uses (bathing, dining, curing, entertaining) and many religious significations, referring to Dionysus, Venus, Aesculapius.

Location Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Villa (Pleiades)
Location Description DESCRIPTION
Villa Adriana, erected by emperor Hadrian at the beginning of the II cent. A.D., occupies a vast area of 126 hectares. It was a beautiful estate strategically located near Tivoli and, at the same time, not very far from Rome (WINNEFELD 1895; KÄHLER 1950; AURIGEMMA 1961; RAKOB 1973; BROWN 1964). Prior to the Hadrianic settlement, an ancient villa, dating back to the late republican time, already stood there. Probably it belonged to Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s family and, as a matter of fact, many scholars think that Hadrian chose this estate as the ideal one because he already knew the place and was attached to it (LUGLI 1927). Certainly he preserved and restored the original building and made it the nucleus of his private quarters.
The realization of this magnificent residence must have been a cherished dream of Hadrian, and he must have planned it long before becoming an emperor. This is the only way to explain how the works for its construction began immediately after his election and his return to Rome in 118 A.D. Hadrian died in 138 A.D. when his ideal residence was nearly completed. Nearly, because there was still some work to be done. Some important halls of the Great Baths were not finished, and the model for a Stadium, found among the ruins of his last building-yard in the quarters of the stonecutters (CAPRINO 1996-97; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, p. 73; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 144-147), was never brought to the unknown place where Hadrian had planned to build it. The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s death put an abrupt end to all activities, and some of the gardens he planned to create, and for which fountains and pavilions had already been built, were never done or, if ever they were completed, seem to have been soon abandoned (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, pp. 000-000). As a matter of fact after him Villa Adriana was only partially lived in by his successors and was solely used for occasional visits. It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial praedia. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden Antinous' tomb (Fig. 1, n. 25) Antinoeion at Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Villa (Pleiades)
Keywords nymphaea (garden structures) tombs Garden Description When, after having asked Dr. Reggiani to write about the garden emerged by her excavations, I began to study the map she kindly sent me (Fig. 75). Mari had informed me that the big structure beside the entrance gate was a Nymphaeum, but this seemed to me really improbable: It was too big and not in scale with the rest. I soon discovered that not only it was not a Nymphaeum but that it was a tomb and I easily connected it with Antinous, the same Antinous who had been deified by the Egyptians (E. SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2002-2003). Hadrian was more than pleased to accept him as a god, thus he could build to his memory a very important monument, something that he could never do for a simple boy. A temple more than a tomb.
I told my discovery to Dr. Reggiani and she decided to send Mari - who up to then had been absolutely sure of his Nymphaeum theory - to do a probe and test my hypothesis.
The excavations proved that I was right and that, also if never completed, there the tomb was made. First of all after his return from his second voyage around his empire Hadrian searched for the right place where to build it and drew his plan (Fig. 76). The place he chose was in direct view from his own quarters so that he would be able to see it - as we say -, “ first time in the morning, last time at night” (Fig. 77). As the area was slanting, the first thing he did was to prepare a platform for the temple and the surrounding garden (Fig. 78).
From our researches we understood that at Hadrian’s death in the 138 A.D. the garden with its Egyptian temples and its enclosure was the only thing to have been completed. The part where the temple-tomb would have been erected (Fig. 79) was only indicated by the big stones with which the architects traced on the ground the principal lines of their plans (VITRUVIUS, I CENT B.C.; W. JONES). However the garden was there and from the soil analysis we also learned that it did survive until the end of the Empire and that was proved by the content of lead of its soil, the same quantity of the one we find in the Canopus’ area and in the other monumental parts of the Imperial Residence created on the plots of never irrigated land acquired by Hadrian, and tended up from the first II century’s years till the end of the Roman Empire (J. E. FOSS, 1989-1990; J. E. FOSS e E. SALZA PRINA RICOTTI, 1996).
Of course all Hadrian’s successors had no intention to complete Hadrian’s plan and, just to give the garden a finishing touch, they substituted the colossal temple-tomb by a modest porch where Hadrian would not even bury a dog (Figg. 80 and 81).
However the garden had been completed and we could reconstruct it basing ourselves on the trenches for the boxtrees edges and the flowering bushes that had been cut in the tufa (Fig. 82). Then, going on, studying its interesting facade wall with niches for statues on both sides, the east ones turned to the entrance road and the west ones looking at the garden (Fig. 83): 20 niches in which probably the 20 Egyptian statue found in the CVII and CVIII centuries excavations were displayed (C. FEA, 1790). Probably here at the two sides of the entrance door stood the two Telamons (H. WINNEFELD, 1895; E. Q. VISCONTI, 1782; II, 18; PENNA III, 29) similar to the representation of Antinous as an Egyptian god (WINNEFELD, 1895) (Fig. 84) the one that with a Harpocrates, had been found in a nearby store room. No document exists for the two Telamons now set at the two sides of the entrance of the “Sala rotonda” in the Vatican Museums, but it is pretty certain that these two statues which in 1500 were set at the two sides of the door of Tivoli’s archbishopric see have been excavated in the Antinous’ tomb area.
In the garden people could admire low white marble basins in which pure water fell by the over standing niches, the two Egyptian marble temple ad all sort of adornments. At the end it was also completed by an obelisk on which, in hieroglyphs, was inscribed the following declaration:
The god we find (Antinous represented in the destroyed higher part of the obelisk) rests in this place that is hidden in the property of “the Lord of prosperity” (princeps) of Rome (then Hadrian in his Villa Adriana).
Basing myself on all this information I drew a garden looking probably like the old one (Fig. 85).
Obviously then, with the fall of the Roman empire and the Barbarian invasions, this place stood exposed to all the pillages that ruined the Roman’s monuments. Heliogabalus began taking the obelisk and bringing it to Rome to be placed in his new circus. Then there were the pillages of the Middle Age. For centuries the local people considered Villa Adriana as an enormous quarry where they went to refurnish their churches of columns and their floors with luxurious slabs of marbles (Fig. 86). They also took bricks for their buildings and burned in their kilns fragments of statues or architectonic moldings to make lime (Fig. 87). They thought it was a very nice thing to do, because, starting from the VIII cent. A.D., the Church requested all believers to destroy the “pagan” works of art and they did it with enthusiasm: Besides completing this “worthy action”, it helped them to obtain the best lime possible for their mortar.
After the passage or this horde of locusts the only things that were left to Villa Adriana were its naked walls and not even all of them, because in 1650, when the Jesuits decided to make there a thriving vineyard, they completely cleaned the area and demolished all the walls that were still standing in Antinous’ garden. The only things that were left untouched were the bases of the two temples. To destroy those large masses of conglomerate would have taken lot of work. Thus they were left there where they stood, and, cutting low trenches in them, were treated exactly as if the they were part of the tufa’s platform (Figg. 88 and 89).
Today on this rocky plain, left naked by an exaggerate excavation, we can see all that happened here, from the big mass of marble fragments prepared for the kilns (and that was left there by the local people who, now had more than enough lime, and never burned them) to the long furrow traced in the tufa platform by the holy Fathers in such a way as to held rain water in them, keep always humid the soil and by capillarity irrigate the young vines.
As we have said at the beginning the Temple-tomb was never completed. Antinous who, at the end of the works, would have been transported there, was left in Antinoopolis’ temple (J. C. GRENIER 1986). Anyway he now was a god with a well asserted religion, and temples (Fig. 90) in a great part of the known world. A cult that thrived up to the middle of the IV century (ATTANASIUS 350 A.D.). However also if Antinous was left in the desert’s sands his memory is still here and visiting Villa Adriana, one can always feel his presence.

Location Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Villa (Pleiades)
Location Description DESCRIPTION
Villa Adriana, erected by emperor Hadrian at the beginning of the II cent. A.D., occupies a vast area of 126 hectares. It was a beautiful estate strategically located near Tivoli and, at the same time, not very far from Rome (WINNEFELD 1895; KÄHLER 1950; AURIGEMMA 1961; RAKOB 1973; BROWN 1964). Prior to the Hadrianic settlement, an ancient villa, dating back to the late republican time, already stood there. Probably it belonged to Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s family and, as a matter of fact, many scholars think that Hadrian chose this estate as the ideal one because he already knew the place and was attached to it (LUGLI 1927). Certainly he preserved and restored the original building and made it the nucleus of his private quarters.
The realization of this magnificent residence must have been a cherished dream of Hadrian, and he must have planned it long before becoming an emperor. This is the only way to explain how the works for its construction began immediately after his election and his return to Rome in 118 A.D. Hadrian died in 138 A.D. when his ideal residence was nearly completed. Nearly, because there was still some work to be done. Some important halls of the Great Baths were not finished, and the model for a Stadium, found among the ruins of his last building-yard in the quarters of the stonecutters (CAPRINO 1996-97; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, p. 73; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 144-147), was never brought to the unknown place where Hadrian had planned to build it. The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s death put an abrupt end to all activities, and some of the gardens he planned to create, and for which fountains and pavilions had already been built, were never done or, if ever they were completed, seem to have been soon abandoned (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, pp. 000-000). As a matter of fact after him Villa Adriana was only partially lived in by his successors and was solely used for occasional visits. It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial praedia. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden Garden arrangement under the Libraries' terrace (Fig. 1, n. 9)
Keywords terrace gardens Garden Description The principal element of this garden (Fig. 28) is the sustaining wall of the overhanging terrace, a kind of theater scenery decorated by a series of 23 alternatively semicircular and square niches (Fig. 29).
However the garden did not occupy the entire plateau. A substantial concentration of lead is found only in the area set in front of the sustaining wall where a garden with its flowerbeds must have been set, while the most northern part of the plateau, where lead is scantily present, must have been occupied by trees and bushes which did not need much watering (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1994-95, fig. 7).

As a matter of fact after him Villa Adriana was only partially lived in by his successors and was solely used for occasional visits. It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial praedia. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden Garden between the nymphaeum on the E side of the Academy and the Praetorium (Fig. 1, n. 24)
Keywords exedrae (site elements) fountains nymphaea (garden structures) Garden Description These gardens, (Fig. 72) never completed, would probably have covered 35.000 square meters. One extended itself between the impressive Nymphaeum waterfall (Fig. 73) set at the eastern side of the Academy and the noble upper part of the so-called Praetorium where a beautiful exedra occupied the center of an elegant pavilion (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1998, pp. 388-390, fig. 17; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 377-381, fig. 137). The two elements faced each other at a distance of 347 m. The minimal presence of lead in the soil of this area and its position connected with the palatial Academy - which now, due to the results of the soil analyses, we know was never completed or inhabited – explain what happened. After the nymphaeum with its beautiful waterfalls (Fig.74) and the facing Praetorium pavilion had been erected, Hadrian died. Everything stopped and Villa Adriana was never completed. Thus, today we can only see the two principal features of this garden: the pavilion and the nymphaeum.
The waterfall-nymphaeum is a very interesting garden monument. Pirro Ligorio first documented it in a sketch now found in the Royal Library of Windsor Castle. It was also represented in all the successive maps of Villa Adriana, starting from Contini, and up to my time. Unluckily Ligorio&amp;rsquo;s plan was faulty and, what is even worse, everybody copied his drawing without taking the pain to study it more thoroughly. Ligorio&amp;rsquo;s error was probably due to the masses of brambles that usually cover these ruins. It seems possible that the only elements that he could see were a small portion of the first waterfall and the total extension of the nymphaeum. Thus he reconstructed what was hidden by the vegetation following his own fantasy and sketched it as a series of narrow waterfalls, obtaining an effect very similar to the one given to visitors of the Villa d&amp;rsquo;Este at Tivoli by the celebrated alley of the “Cento Fontanelle”.
I had the chance to find this nymphaeum cleaned from vegetation and therefore I was able to survey it properly (Fig. 73). Originally it seems to have consisted of eight waterfalls, 3.55 m wide, four on each side of a very large one 15 m wide. The waterfalls were divided by pillars of masonry of 2.30 x 1.50 m decorated by semicircular niches 1.40 m wide and m 1.90 high.
In a second moment, after the nymphaeum had been completed, the first small waterfall on the western side was destroyed and an exit to the Great Carriages Underground Road was created in its place. To understand when this change was done we must keep in mind that, as the last findings about lead content of the archaeological sites' soil prove, the Academy, that was probably destined to Sabina, who - I suspect - returned ailing from her travels with Hadrian and never came to Villa Adriana. She stayed in Rome and there she died. Thus the access of the carriages to this area must have been decided in Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s time, when it was still thought that the residence would have been lived in. The successors of Hadrian; who didn&amp;rsquo;t wish to occupy this part of Villa Adriana, would never have cared to open an access to the underground carriages road. In conclusion this change must have been done between 128 and 136 A.D. It certainly was decided by Hadrian.

Garden Garden in the courtyard of the buildings to the East of the Inferi Nymphaeum (Fig. 1, n. 22)
Keywords exedrae (site elements) nymphaea (garden structures) Garden Description The presence of a garden on the eastern side of this luxurious pavilion with its monumental exedra is denounced by the high presence of lead in its soil (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1994-95, fig. 7). Although peripheral to the Hadrianic residence, this place must have been of great importance. There was a very large building that at this moment is still a bit of mystery (Figg. 65 and 66). It is quite far away, it has a monumental terrace on which Piranesi imagined a little round temple; during my survey I found fragments of fine marbles all around it and the floors of the rooms around the terrace are paved with mosaic. Apart of all this it must have had some special meaning also for the successors of Hadrian as it was tended with particular care up to the end of the Empire. That is very strange. This garden is set in an area where some very important buildings, as the Academy, the Odeon and other luxurious pavilions existed but, at Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, were abandoned and never watered, while the so called “Temple of Pluto&amp;quot; was tended up till the end of the Roman Empire. We can&amp;rsquo;t avoid asking ourselves: “Why?”
The only explanation seems to be the fact that Hadrian, who not only was introduced to the Eleusinian mysteries but reached in them the highest degree. Thus he could have wanted to recreate in his residence a memento of them, and not only as Spartianus wrote: “ And as nothing could be missed, there he created also the Inferi.” A death reign all for him! I don’t think it is very alluring, but a memento to the Eleusinian misteries, definitely yes, and for this it is acceptable to believe that he created a big holy building and near by a grotto to remember everybody of the Plutonium (Fig. 67).

Some important halls of the Great Baths were not finished, and the model for a Stadium, found among the ruins of his last building-yard in the quarters of the stonecutters (CAPRINO 1996-97; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, p. 73; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 144-147), was never brought to the unknown place where Hadrian had planned to build it.

Garden Description Quite certainly there was a garden here, but we don&amp;rsquo;t have any elements to help us to reconstruct its appearance (Fig. 36). Only a trench was by me excavated in the western part of the courtyard, just in front of the Hadrianic stibadium used in summer for open-air dining (Fig.37). I wanted to ascertain if here, as in the Canopus' coenatio, there had also been an euripus, but the probe gave no result, and anyway the digging was too limited to help our understanding of the place.

Garden Garden of the triclinium North of the Maritime Theatre (Fig. 1, n. 7)
Keywords cyzigene fountains nymphaea (garden structures) triclinia (rooms) Garden Description Today what is left of this garden is a nymphaeum 7 m long and 3.50 m large. It was set against a wall on its northern side and served as a background to the area. It consisted of a small, marble lined fountain, with a basin at its front and five square niches set on a semieliptic line at its back (Fig. 23). On the southern end, a porch, with a white mosaic paving, was set in front of a triclinium of the kind called cyzigene, which means a dining room encircled by a garden (Fig. 24). That left free only an area 34 m long and 21 m wide, set between the triclinium and the nymphaeum; not very much but quite enough to create a pleasant green scenery.
This garden, which stood between two of the highlights of Villa Adriana - the Teatro Marittimo to the South, and the Libraries to the East - while the red marble statue of a faun - one of the most important masterpieces found in this imperial residence - was discovered walled up in a niche of the sustaining wall of its terrace, was certainly very important.

Keywords columns (architectural elements) porticoes Garden Description This garden was placed to the east of the Palace and, looking the Valley of Tempe, was sustained by a huge wall (Fig. 1, 15). Now nothing of it is left, but in ancient times a long portico ran all along the eastern side of the terrace. For what is written in Contini&amp;rsquo;s notes, in 1658 many columns of gray marble with corinthian capitals were still standing in the place. Afterwards, Piranesi (who, in 1781, surveyed Villa Adriana, and published a new map of it) found that some of them had been brought to the Vatican Museums. Today only the beautiful view from the terrace and the considerable presence of lead in the soil (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1994-95, fig. 7) denounces the presence of this ancient garden.

Keywords nymphaea (garden structures) Garden Description The Palace nymphaeum (LUGLI 1927) has already been published quite extensively in the proceedings of the last symposium on ancient Roman Gardens held in Rome in 1995 (JASHEMSKI, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987-88, pp. 151-154, figs. 6-8; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1998, pp. 385-388, figs. 15-16; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 361-367, figs. 129-133). This water theater was shaped like an auditorium. A monumental entry (Fig. 38, H) led the way to a large paved area where low walls contained either two oval flowerbeds or two small basins (Fig. 38 A). An emicycle concluded the arrangement and sustained the pressure of the higher grounds that rose at the back of the garden.
To understand how it must have been we can study the two cross sections. One, W –W1, shows us the front of the badly ruined nymphaeum (Fig. 39). It collected the water that fell in it presumably to feed the same kind of small marble lined waterfalls we have seen in the so-called Stadium. Probably the same hedges of box trees grown in big mortar containers were set amid them. The other cross section (S – S1) show what once was the emicyle in very bad condition (Fig. 40). During the centuries following the fall of the Roman Empire it was destroyed by the peasants who occupied the area, and its decoration has been completely pillaged leaving only the concrete of the basements. Luckily finding some elements, like the remains of a cistern which provided the water for the water falls, the canal circling the top of the emicycle, and the bottom one which runs on the side of the mixtilinear basin (the same technical elements which we find in the so-called Stadium emicycle), give us the possibility to reconstruct the nymphaeum (Fig. 41).
We can have an idea how it looked at the beginning of the XIX century in a drawing by Penna (Fig. 42). However the modern situation is even worse (Fig. 43). We made a probe along the emicycle (Fig. 44) and at its top we found the rest of the same kind of canal that in the Stadium Nymphaeum brought water to the small marble lined waterfall (Fig. 45). It was then possible to understand that the two were quite similar.

Location Description DESCRIPTION
Villa Adriana, erected by emperor Hadrian at the beginning of the II cent. A.D., occupies a vast area of 126 hectares. It was a beautiful estate strategically located near Tivoli and, at the same time, not very far from Rome (WINNEFELD 1895; KÄHLER 1950; AURIGEMMA 1961; RAKOB 1973; BROWN 1964). Prior to the Hadrianic settlement, an ancient villa, dating back to the late republican time, already stood there. Probably it belonged to Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s family and, as a matter of fact, many scholars think that Hadrian chose this estate as the ideal one because he already knew the place and was attached to it (LUGLI 1927). Certainly he preserved and restored the original building and made it the nucleus of his private quarters.
The realization of this magnificent residence must have been a cherished dream of Hadrian, and he must have planned it long before becoming an emperor. This is the only way to explain how the works for its construction began immediately after his election and his return to Rome in 118 A.D. Hadrian died in 138 A.D. when his ideal residence was nearly completed. Nearly, because there was still some work to be done. Some important halls of the Great Baths were not finished, and the model for a Stadium, found among the ruins of his last building-yard in the quarters of the stonecutters (CAPRINO 1996-97; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, p. 73; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 144-147), was never brought to the unknown place where Hadrian had planned to build it. The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s death put an abrupt end to all activities, and some of the gardens he planned to create, and for which fountains and pavilions had already been built, were never done or, if ever they were completed, seem to have been soon abandoned (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, pp. 000-000). As a matter of fact after him Villa Adriana was only partially lived in by his successors and was solely used for occasional visits. It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial praedia. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden Peristyle-garden on the eastern side of the Republican villa (Fig. 1, n. 18)
Keywords flower gardens nymphaea (garden structures) peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes Garden Description This garden was set in the middle of a luxurious peristyle (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 335-337, fig. 116). Unluckily only its western part has been preserved. From what we find now on this side of the area, and from the ancient surveys showing the entire garden still existing in the XVIII cent., we can imagine how it must have looked. It was the kind which we call “hortus conclusus”, and it was enclosed by high walls decorated by a series of niches with semicircular ones alternating with square ones (Figg. 51; 52 and 53). Columns stood between them, and were set in the walls in such a way that only half of them emerged, looking as a sequence of half columns. Today only the groove left by them in the masonry, and the remains of the fine opus sectile which, once, covered the portico&amp;rsquo;s soil, allow us to imagine how it was decorated. At the two extremities of the western wall two very small nymphaea set in two narrow niches refreshed the air with their fountains (Fig. 51, a and b ). Apart from this today we can only see three large rooms, opening on the garden, which occupied the northern side of the peristyle. All the rest has been devastated by the agricultural exploitation of the land. Savage plowing and the destruction of both the portico and the enclosure to create ampler space for planting more olive trees and other crops, has caused landslides which have engulfed all the eastern part of this garden. Unluckily here there was no tufa platform to save the garden structure, and this is a pity, because this garden, connected with the Palace, must have been very interesting and the quantity of lead present in its soil shows that it was much cared for (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1994-95, fig. 7).

It ran parallel to the buildings of the libraries and occupied all its northern front. At its extremities the euripus expanded in two octagonal basins which had flowerbeds at their centers (Fig. 26). Two other smaller basins decorated the garden (Fig. 25, B-C). We can see one in the photo (Fig. 27).

It was a beautiful estate strategically located near Tivoli and, at the same time, not very far from Rome (WINNEFELD 1895; KÄHLER 1950; AURIGEMMA 1961; RAKOB 1973; BROWN 1964).

Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.

Location Description DESCRIPTION
Villa Adriana, erected by emperor Hadrian at the beginning of the II cent. A.D., occupies a vast area of 126 hectares. It was a beautiful estate strategically located near Tivoli and, at the same time, not very far from Rome (WINNEFELD 1895; KÄHLER 1950; AURIGEMMA 1961; RAKOB 1973; BROWN 1964). Prior to the Hadrianic settlement, an ancient villa, dating back to the late republican time, already stood there. Probably it belonged to Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s family and, as a matter of fact, many scholars think that Hadrian chose this estate as the ideal one because he already knew the place and was attached to it (LUGLI 1927). Certainly he preserved and restored the original building and made it the nucleus of his private quarters.
The realization of this magnificent residence must have been a cherished dream of Hadrian, and he must have planned it long before becoming an emperor. This is the only way to explain how the works for its construction began immediately after his election and his return to Rome in 118 A.D. Hadrian died in 138 A.D. when his ideal residence was nearly completed. Nearly, because there was still some work to be done. Some important halls of the Great Baths were not finished, and the model for a Stadium, found among the ruins of his last building-yard in the quarters of the stonecutters (CAPRINO 1996-97; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, p. 73; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 144-147), was never brought to the unknown place where Hadrian had planned to build it. The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s death put an abrupt end to all activities, and some of the gardens he planned to create, and for which fountains and pavilions had already been built, were never done or, if ever they were completed, seem to have been soon abandoned (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, pp. 000-000). As a matter of fact after him Villa Adriana was only partially lived in by his successors and was solely used for occasional visits. It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial praedia. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden The Belvedere of the Venus of Cnidus (Fig. 1, n. 11)
Keywords exedrae (site elements) nymphaea (garden structures) Garden Description This Belvedere is not really a garden. The area is all paved with luxurious opus sectile, and, therefore, there were no flowerbeds, but in every important park, beside bushes and blooming plants, there are always some elegant pavilions and exedras where one could pause and take a rest reading a book or talking with friends. Of course, you can&amp;rsquo;t have such a thing in small private house gardens where the area is restricted and all the space must be used for growing colorful blossoms. On the contrary in large extension of space they make necessary spots of interest where strollers can pause to enjoy the beauty of the thereabouts (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 388-390, fig. 139). The Belvedere of the Venus of Cnidus (Fig. 31) is one of them and it is also one of the most charming (ORTOLANI 1998). It was placed on a hillock overlooking the so-called Valley of Tempe. Two large exedras (Fig. 31, D) were laid on one of its sides; a round temple (Fig. 32) sheltering a copy of the Venus of Cnidus by Praxiteles stood at its center (Fig. 31, B), and, from it, the view ranged over Tivoli and the Appennine mountains in the background, really an enchanted place with a stunning view.
The Belvedere was created in those areas bought by Hadrian to have enough space to realize his project. Between it and the republican property ran a road that had deeply cut the tufa and to join the two parts Hadrian had to construct on the road a barrel vault to sustain the necessary soil (Fig. 33).

Keywords cisterns (plumbing components) columns (architectural elements) exedrae (site elements) flower gardens mosaics (visual works) porticoes statues canals (waterways) Garden Description The Canopus (Fig. 2 and 3) is perhaps the most important of all Villa Adriana&amp;rsquo;s gardens (JASHEMSKI, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987-88, pp. 152-162, fig. 11-15; JASHEMSKI, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992, pp. 579-585, tavv. I-IV; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1998, pp. 374-383, fig. 9-13; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 323-324, fig. 80-81, 87, 134-135). It was set at the principal entrance through which Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s important guests were introduced when they came to visit the emperor. Thus the breathtaking view of the Canopus was the first impression visitors received entering this imperial residence. Their glance ran along the narrow valley set at the South side of Villa Adriana&amp;rsquo;s principal entry. An imposing waterway occupied all its length (Fig. 4). Columns and white marble statues reflected themselves in its blue water, and two statuary groups, both representing Scylla in the act of killing Ulysses' mates, emerged from the canal. It was here that Hadrian held his most important receptions and the banquets that, from time to time, he offered to his subjects (MART. 8.49; 9.91). As in ancient Rome dinner began around two o' clock p.m., and as, at this moment, the sun was still very high and very hot, a portico ran along the eastern bank offering its shade to those guests who had to dine on the sunny side (Fig. 2, A). On the opposite one, which was already protected by the hill, there was no portico (Fig. 2, B), but four beautiful copies of the Erecteum&amp;rsquo;s Caryatids and of two Sylens were set on the canal&amp;rsquo;s edge and were reflected on the water (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987, pp. 175-178, figs. 13-20, 35-37). The spectacle was superb: the golden color of the portico&amp;rsquo;s columns, fashioned in the yellow marble of Shimtou, stood out against the green of the well-cut hedges of box-tree that bordered the lowest part of the valley (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000a), while high terraces rose at its two sides scaling the surrounding hills (Figg. 4 and 5) To complete the landscaping, a monumental exedra, (Fig. 6) and two elegant pavilion set at its sides (Figg. 2. D and D1 7) decorated the end of the valley (Fig. 2, C). In the old times the exedra was coated with polished marbles and multicolored mosaics. Some of its niches hosted imposing statues and large waterfalls flowed by other ones, while back, at the end of a central long gallery, a powerful cascade fed the outlying waterway (Fig. 2, E). Nothing could have been more pleasant and at the same time more imposing than the Canopus.
Then excavations in the valley showed the existence of two long flower beds that were set on the two side of the canal (Fig. 8) and in them both we and the Danish archaeologists found amphoras cut in two and with large holes on their sides to let the plant kept in them to branch their roots in the soil and remain strong and flourishing. Our probes are marked on the plan (Fig 2. m; n; o; p; q).

Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.

Today the finding of the enormous amount of lead in its soil (1234 mg/kg) (Fig. 17) has created a new interest in it (FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1998, pp. 368-370, fig. 3; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 331-334, figs. 114-115). It proves that this plot of land was exploited for a very long time starting from the earlier republican era. Probably at those times a huge reservoir existed there and the land was kept as an orchard. Later on, just before the end of the I cent. B.C., it must have been transformed in a garden (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1994-95, p. 78, fig. 5) and the front of this cistern was decorated by an elegant nymphaeum (Figg. 18 and 19). In Hadrianic times the baths displaced the water reserve, but the nymphaeum was preserved. It must have been a particularly fine and elegant monument if Hadrian decided to save it and made it an important part of his new garden arrangement. The Augustan water-theater consisted of a 19.50 m long façade, adorned by two low basins, which stretched out from semielliptical niches (PENNA 1831, p. 59, fig. 59). We still see in them two low pedestals, evidently built to sustain some fountain statues. Other statues must have occupied the three square niches framed by small columns, which, set at a level of 1.84 m from the soil, flanked the basins' ones. The big piscina limaria, that supplied the two thermae, replaced the ancient reservoir and furnished large quantities of water. It soaked the ground and allowed the cultivation of plants that had to be frequently and abundantly watered. It is evident that only an uninterrupted irrigation delivered for at least eight centuries through leaden pipes could deposit in the soil such a high concentration of this metal.

Location Description DESCRIPTION
Villa Adriana, erected by emperor Hadrian at the beginning of the II cent. A.D., occupies a vast area of 126 hectares. It was a beautiful estate strategically located near Tivoli and, at the same time, not very far from Rome (WINNEFELD 1895; KÄHLER 1950; AURIGEMMA 1961; RAKOB 1973; BROWN 1964). Prior to the Hadrianic settlement, an ancient villa, dating back to the late republican time, already stood there. Probably it belonged to Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s family and, as a matter of fact, many scholars think that Hadrian chose this estate as the ideal one because he already knew the place and was attached to it (LUGLI 1927). Certainly he preserved and restored the original building and made it the nucleus of his private quarters.
The realization of this magnificent residence must have been a cherished dream of Hadrian, and he must have planned it long before becoming an emperor. This is the only way to explain how the works for its construction began immediately after his election and his return to Rome in 118 A.D. Hadrian died in 138 A.D. when his ideal residence was nearly completed. Nearly, because there was still some work to be done. Some important halls of the Great Baths were not finished, and the model for a Stadium, found among the ruins of his last building-yard in the quarters of the stonecutters (CAPRINO 1996-97; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, p. 73; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 144-147), was never brought to the unknown place where Hadrian had planned to build it. The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s death put an abrupt end to all activities, and some of the gardens he planned to create, and for which fountains and pavilions had already been built, were never done or, if ever they were completed, seem to have been soon abandoned (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, pp. 000-000). As a matter of fact after him Villa Adriana was only partially lived in by his successors and was solely used for occasional visits. It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial praedia. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996).

Garden Description Here only the considerable presence of lead in the soil denounces the existence of an ancient garden (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1994-95, fig. 7). It is clear that this space, which was the point of arrival of the most important guests coming to dine with the emperor, must have been elegantly arranged. At its same level we can still admire some luxurious guestrooms with superb marble floorings. It stands to reason that the area around them must have been well planned and well kept.

Garden The Garden of the Piazza d&amp;rsquo;Oro (Fig. 1, n. 20) Piazza d&amp;rsquo;Oro at Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Villa (Pleiades)
Keywords flower gardens peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes Garden Description The garden of the Piazza d&amp;rsquo;Oro is one of the most prestigious and interesting of Villa Adriana. It consists of a peristyle garden set amid a double portico and surrounded by some of the most elegant buildings of this imperial residence (Figg. 54 and 55). The garden, which occupies the central part of the peristyle, was probed in 1987. Afterwards, in 1988, with the sponsorship of Dumbarton Oaks and the help of the Latium Superintendence, it was partially excavated (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987, pp. 180-181, figs. 29-34; JASHEMSKI, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987-88, pp. 162-169, figs. 16-22; JASHEMSKI, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992, pp. 585-595, figs. 8-17; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1998, pp. 370-374, figs. 4-8; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 339-354, figs. 117-126). Here the nearly surfacing platform of tufa was a great help to find where the flowerbeds were and how the garden was arranged (Fig. 56). The first thing that was discovered was a double line of deep holes, m 1.80 long, 0.90 wide and 1.20 deep which circled all the area (Fig. 56, f). Their size proved that they were meant for trees, but which ones? As we didn&amp;rsquo;t find any seeds, pollens or roots to help us in identifying them, we must rely on what was written in ancient texts. From Pliny we know that in their gardens Romans used cypresses (PLIN. nat. 16.60.139-141; PLIN. epist. 5.6.16-17), plane trees (PLIN. nat. 12.3-5), pine trees, pomegranates, oleanders, laurels (PLIN. nat. 15.49.197) and, at the end of the Republic, even lemon trees (PLIN. nat. 1.15-16; see JASHEMSKI 1979, pp. 77-79).
These indications have been confirmed by the studies that Prof. Jashemski carried out in Pompeii, Herculaneum and other places (JASHEMSKI 1979, passim; 1993, passim). Of all the trees listed by the great naturalist we must immediately discard cypresses, as the ones that Pliny the Younger described in the hippodrome-garden of his Tuscany villa (PLIN. epist. 5.6.32-40). Also if those trees could be cut in shapes suited to the garden&amp;rsquo;s design by topiary artists and could be very decorative, their foliage begins at a very low level and the trees tend to be very high, thus they are very good for fencing an enclosure, but here, at the Piazza d&amp;rsquo;Oro, where the garden was planned to be seen from the surrounding porticoes, they would have completely hidden it. Thereupon we must revert to more convenient trees or bushes, like laurels, which grow very well in the area and whose foliage could be kept very high, in such a way that the trees would not hide the view, or like the ever present box tree (PLIN. nat. 16.28.70) which could be cut in conveniently low green hedges. Flowering bushes and, maybe, Pliny&amp;rsquo;s violets (PLIN. nat. 21.14 and 47) set in decorative designs could have grown in the central part of the garden. In the middle of the area a beautiful white marble euripus, set between the entrance hall, on one side, and the tricliniar pavilion with all its fountains, on the other (Fig. 56, m), reflected the encircling buildings with their polished walls. The view must have been very similar to the scene we now admire on the water of the Taj Mahal&amp;rsquo;s canal at Agra.
Entering in the Piazza d’Oro the ancient garden extends itself before our view (Fig. 57). It is not a garden anymore but we can detect his planning by the structure that are still surfacing and it is stunning. Also fascinating is the spectacle we enjoy looking from the pavilion at the distant domed entrance hall. The large euripus, once all lined by white marble, is displayed before us (Fig. 58): We can easily imagine how, when the building was new and probably resplendent in its revetments, its marbles and all the refined decorations, its view would have been reflected in the limpid cana giving us the same effect that today we can enjoy visiting the Taj Mahal at Agra.
But there were not only the beauty and the refinement that appealed to us at the Piazza d’Oro. Very interesting was discovering all the gardening technics applied in it. Fascinating for instance was the watering system we found in the Piazza d&amp;rsquo;Oro garden (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1989-90). There were two canals each circling half o the garden. Te western one running 60 cm under the soil infiltrated directly at this level water in canal cut in the tufa and covered by masonry vaults (Fig. 59). The irrigation seeped directly in the garden canals through low rectangular cuts opened in the tufa (Fig. 60). All the flowerbeds had those canals, well cut and done by an accurate team of gardeners (Fig. 61). With this system as a consequence of the phenomenon of capillarity, every time the surface dried, the moisture rose up from the bottom and watered the roots of the plants; thus there was not even the loss of the good elements contained in the soil. Then, when the irrigation went on, little by little the soil, contained at the bottom of these trenches, became very soaked and water ran quickly toward the drainage canal. As a simple sluice, set at the start of the irrigation canal (Fig. 62), controlled all this system. To water nearly all the area a single man had only to lift it, and the same man could with a simple movement close the sluice when the soil didn’t absorb more water.
Then when it was closed and all the water furnished by the pavilion fountains went to the eastern canal.
Here there was a different way to water the plants. Due to their inclination the canals were too deep for the capillarity, but all the same were still continued for letting them to reach the drainage canal. Thus in the eastern part of the garden a very old system was used, one that we find in Pasagarde, the splendid Cyrus park. Here marble lined canals joined a series of cubic basins. In the Piazza d’Oro the eastern canal, that in ancient times was completely covered by a vault, but that now for a spell lays in the open, had many little pits excavated in its bottom (Fig. 63). Over each one of them was placed a pump. Probably bronze ones that were pillaged in the middle age at the time of the “metals hunger”. The breaks in the canal’s vault (Fig. 56, p) seems to confirm this hypothesis.

Location Description DESCRIPTION
Villa Adriana, erected by emperor Hadrian at the beginning of the II cent. A.D., occupies a vast area of 126 hectares. It was a beautiful estate strategically located near Tivoli and, at the same time, not very far from Rome (WINNEFELD 1895; KÄHLER 1950; AURIGEMMA 1961; RAKOB 1973; BROWN 1964). Prior to the Hadrianic settlement, an ancient villa, dating back to the late republican time, already stood there. Probably it belonged to Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s family and, as a matter of fact, many scholars think that Hadrian chose this estate as the ideal one because he already knew the place and was attached to it (LUGLI 1927). Certainly he preserved and restored the original building and made it the nucleus of his private quarters.
The realization of this magnificent residence must have been a cherished dream of Hadrian, and he must have planned it long before becoming an emperor. This is the only way to explain how the works for its construction began immediately after his election and his return to Rome in 118 A.D. Hadrian died in 138 A.D. when his ideal residence was nearly completed. Nearly, because there was still some work to be done. Some important halls of the Great Baths were not finished, and the model for a Stadium, found among the ruins of his last building-yard in the quarters of the stonecutters (CAPRINO 1996-97; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, p. 73; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 144-147), was never brought to the unknown place where Hadrian had planned to build it. The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s death put an abrupt end to all activities, and some of the gardens he planned to create, and for which fountains and pavilions had already been built, were never done or, if ever they were completed, seem to have been soon abandoned (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, pp. 000-000). As a matter of fact after him Villa Adriana was only partially lived in by his successors and was solely used for occasional visits. It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial praedia. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden The garden of the tomb (Fig. 1, n. 21) Piazza d&amp;rsquo;Oro at Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Villa (Pleiades)
Keywords tombs Garden Description We always find open spaces around the more important tombs and we know that they were kept as gardens. Just last summer Prof. Foss analyzed the samples drawn from the enclosure of the tomb of Romulus, Massenzio&amp;rsquo;s son, on the Appian way, and found a large quantity of lead in it, lead that was not found in other parts of this emperor&amp;rsquo;s villa, as in its famed Circus (Fig. 64). It is evident that the area around this tomb was kept as a garden and that it was watered for quite a long period. Of the garden around the tomb found on the back of the Piazza d&amp;rsquo;Oro we can only say that, as the Romulus tomb, it was set in a very large enclosure. Lead was present but not in very large quantity (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1994-95, fig. 7), thus it must have been set with big trees and bushes that didn&amp;rsquo;t need much irrigation If tufa is present here as in the nearby garden, and if ever the Tomb&amp;rsquo;s area will be excavated, we probably might find the same kind of arrangements for planting trees as in the Piazza d&amp;rsquo;Oro.

Villa Adriana, erected by emperor Hadrian at the beginning of the II cent. A.D., occupies a vast area of 126 hectares. It was a beautiful estate strategically located near Tivoli and, at the same time, not very far from Rome (WINNEFELD 1895; KÄHLER 1950; AURIGEMMA 1961; RAKOB 1973; BROWN 1964).

The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s death put an abrupt end to all activities, and some of the gardens he planned to create, and for which fountains and pavilions had already been built, were never done or, if ever they were completed, seem to have been soon abandoned (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, pp. 000-000). As a matter of fact after him Villa Adriana was only partially lived in by his successors and was solely used for occasional visits. It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial praedia. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden The gardens at the entrance of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s villa (Fig. 1, n. 3)
Keywords flower gardens peristyles (Roman courtyards) tufa Garden Description The Great Entrance Hall of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s villa (Fig. 9) presents three gardens, two of which (Fig. 9, A and G) are peristyle ones.
a – The main gate to the Hadrianic residence opens up on a peristyle garden, the largest one. Having just been excavated by Dr. Anna Maria Reggiani, the Latium&amp;rsquo;s Superintendent, it is published by her at p. 000 .
b –The other garden (Figs. 9, G, and 10-11), set at the eastern side of the entrance hall, occupies a smaller peristyle with a curved side toward East (REICHARDT 1933). It was crossed in the middle by a path which had a round-shaped space in the center (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987, pp. 175-178, figs. 13-20; JASHEMSKI, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987-88, p. 147, figs. 1-2; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1998, pp. 364-366, fig. 1; MARI, REGGIANI, RIGHI 2000; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 323-324, fig. 110). Here some decorative element - a marble vase or a statue - was probably displayed. Two flowerbeds cut in the tufa flanked it (Figs. 10, G, and 11). We are still pretty sure that they were bordered by well-groomed box hedges, a kind of decoration which was afterwards inherited by the “all&amp;rsquo;italiana” system of landscaping. This fashion, widely employed in many outstanding examples of Renaissance gardens, is still in use nowadays. The presence of well cut green hedges bordering those ancient flowerbeds was a must and it is a sure fact that they existed here, but we know very little about the rest. For instance, what, if anything, could have been set in their central part? Prof. Jashemski found pollen, seeds, roots of flowering bushes and of some trees in her Pompeian gardens, but here at Villa Adriana nothing was left in the ground. We are bound to follow our imagination. Of course there could have been grass in the center of the flowerbeds as well as masses of blossoms. If the latter was the case - but, looking to “all&amp;rsquo;italiana” gardens, which are basically green gardens, I highly doubt it - the flowers should have been the kinds which were in fashion in ancient Roman times. In his Natural History (nat. 21.10), Pliny the Older explained that Romans didn&amp;rsquo;t use many of them. In their gardens they mainly planted roses and violets. However we must keep in mind that, for Pliny, the word violets meant every kind of small herbaceous species that could produce colored blossoms. He catalogued many kinds of them as the yellow, the purple, and the white kind, and it is highly probable that they must have been pimpernels as well as hyacinths and, of course real violets too. It is, however, evident that any of these plants could create gay clusters of blossoms in the center of a flowerbed and that they could make a very appealing garden.
c – The third garden of the Great Entrance Hall occupies its extreme western part (REICHARDT 1933, pp. 129-130). Here an unpaved courtyard circled a small temple, probably dedicated to the Imperial Lares (Fig. 9, L). The flowerbeds have still to be excavated, but, as in all the Great Entrance Hall&amp;rsquo;s area the tufa is practically surfacing, this must happen also here. Therefore it is highly probable that an excavation will bring to light the flowerbeds cut in the rock for the plants.

Garden The Libraries' Courtyard (Fig. 1, n. 13) Libraries' Courtyard at Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Villa (Pleiades)
Keywords flower gardens nymphaea (garden structures) peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes Garden Description This garden belongs to the republican period and it is one of the most ancient of Villa Adriana. It is enclosed in a large peristyle 48 m wide, 72 m long. The place seems to have been watered from the Republican time up to the end of the Roman Empire, and the content of lead in its soil is among the highest in the area (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1994-95, fig. 7). At the center of the portico&amp;rsquo;s northern side, there still is a republican nymphaeum with a rectangular plan and very thick walls: a vaulted hall decorated with a series of niches, but quite heavy and gloomy (Fig. 35, E). There must have been flowerbeds in the peristyle, but the garden has still to be excavated. Now an olive grove occupies the place, and I doubt that anybody would dare to cut it down. However, if this would ever happen, we must hope to ascertain the presence of tufa surfacing in this area and, thus, find the hole cut in the rock to create the flowerbeds. It would be the only way to discover how the place had been planned.

Location Description DESCRIPTION
Villa Adriana, erected by emperor Hadrian at the beginning of the II cent. A.D., occupies a vast area of 126 hectares. It was a beautiful estate strategically located near Tivoli and, at the same time, not very far from Rome (WINNEFELD 1895; KÄHLER 1950; AURIGEMMA 1961; RAKOB 1973; BROWN 1964). Prior to the Hadrianic settlement, an ancient villa, dating back to the late republican time, already stood there. Probably it belonged to Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s family and, as a matter of fact, many scholars think that Hadrian chose this estate as the ideal one because he already knew the place and was attached to it (LUGLI 1927). Certainly he preserved and restored the original building and made it the nucleus of his private quarters.
The realization of this magnificent residence must have been a cherished dream of Hadrian, and he must have planned it long before becoming an emperor. This is the only way to explain how the works for its construction began immediately after his election and his return to Rome in 118 A.D. Hadrian died in 138 A.D. when his ideal residence was nearly completed. Nearly, because there was still some work to be done. Some important halls of the Great Baths were not finished, and the model for a Stadium, found among the ruins of his last building-yard in the quarters of the stonecutters (CAPRINO 1996-97; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, p. 73; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 144-147), was never brought to the unknown place where Hadrian had planned to build it. The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s death put an abrupt end to all activities, and some of the gardens he planned to create, and for which fountains and pavilions had already been built, were never done or, if ever they were completed, seem to have been soon abandoned (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, pp. 000-000). As a matter of fact after him Villa Adriana was only partially lived in by his successors and was solely used for occasional visits. It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial praedia. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden The Pecile (Fig. 1, n. 6) Pecile at Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Villa (Pleiades)
Keywords columns (architectural elements) flower gardens peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes tufa Garden Description The Pecile (Fig. 20) was never excavated as a garden. Thus, today, we have only the large pond, 30 m wide x 116 m long (Fig. 21) which hosts a flock of white geese (Fig. 20, A). A garden must have been spread all around it, but its flowerbeds need still to be investigated (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 139-141, fig. 45). If, as in Villa Adriana often happens, they have been dug in the tufa platform, sooner or later we will be able to see their shapes and reconstruct the garden&amp;rsquo;s appearance. For the moment we have to be content with the dark green bushes which, cut in the shape of columns, mark the spots once occupied by the ones of the monumental peristyle 100 m wide and 248 m long. On the northern side of the Pecile, we can still admire the long wall around which, once, ran the double portico used by the Emperor for his daily strolls (Fig. 20, B): three spins around the central wall corresponded to a mile as written on a marble slate (HÜLSEN 1896; MANCINI 1952; COARELLI 1997, pp. 207-209). He could circle around it as many times as his doctor had prescribed him to do (Fig. 22). According to ancient Romans' belief, long walks offered an opportunity to exercise and were necessary to preserve both health and fitness. At the western end of the Pecile, a pillared Belvedere offered to Villa Adriana&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants the possibility to rest from time to time admiring the underlying plain and the city of Rome far away on the horizon.

As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden The so-called Inferi Nymphaeum (Fig. 1, n. 23)
Keywords fountains nymphaea (garden structures) Garden Description The so-called Inferi (Figg. 68 and 69) is a garden arrangement placed a little South of the tomb and closely connected with the building called the “Temple of Pluto” set just East of it. This peculiar landscaping arrangement was created excavating a narrow artificial valley in the slopes of the grounds that here are climbing up towards the Santo Stefano Hill, while the Inferi’s garden went down to rejoin the same level of the underground carriages' road, which, as a modern subway, connected all the buildings of Villa Adriana (MACDONALD, PINTO 1995, pp. 143-145; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1998, pp. 390-395, figs. 18-19; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 303-305, figs. 25, 138). The small vale, 128 m long and 17 m wide, terminated, at its southern extremity, in a dark grotto 5.10 m wide and 7.20 m deep (Fig. 68, P). At the end of the small cave a narrow cleaving (Fig. 68, A) not even 40-30 cm large and diminishing all the time, is all that is left of an ancient fountain (Fig.70). At Contini&amp;rsquo;s time the grotto must have been nearly filled by soil and so it still was in the XIX century as we can see in a Penna drawing (Fig. 71), However Contini could have seen only the top of the Inferi. This can explain why the Roman 17nth century architect traced an inexistent gallery connecting the small nymphaeum with the trapezoidal system of large galleries which served as parking place and stables to the Great Underground Carriage Road. Contini, impressed by Aelius Spartianus' assertion “etiam Inferos finxit” (Hist. Aug., Hadr. 26.5), believed that all the gigantic underground parts of this area were a representation of the afterlife. Thus he supposed that a gallery must have connected with this antrum - which he thought to be the entrance of the reign of Pluto - with the Great Trapeze.
In reality the Inferi Nymphaeum, as any other part of Villa Adriana, was only linked to the underground road. A gallery starting from the middle of the eastern semicircular tunnel (Fig. 68, L) connected the little valley, and indirectly also the building called “Pluto&amp;rsquo;s Temple”, to the subterranean communication route (Fig. 68, E).
Today the small glen, which from 1969 on and through all 1972 was kept free of vegetation, has just been cleaned, and a kind of wild jungle, that developed in it during the last 30 years, has been uprooted. It needs badly to be excavated and the findings will certainly be rewarding. To begin with it is probable that an euripus will be found in its middle. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that, on both sides of the valley and just 16.50 m before the grotto, we find the openings of the two semicircular galleries leading to the nymphaeum (Fig. 68, B-C). One of them was surely necessary because from its middle started the gallery connecting it with the Great Underground Carriage Road; but the only objective of the other one (Fig. 68, C) was to reach the grotto. Why? If there had not been any hindrance anyone could have gotten there through the vale or, in case of a basin barring the entrance, even through the eastern gallery. There was no need of a second one. Thus this fact points up that:
1 - the access to the Nymphaeum must have been barred, probably by a basin (Fig. 68, H);
2 - a canal running up from the Nymphaeum to the end of the valley (Fig. 68, G) must have divided two sidewalks set on both sides of the small valley. Only this could create the necessity of a second gallery to connect the grotto with the western side of the dale.
Romans, as we know, never did anything unnecessary just for symmetry&amp;rsquo;s sake. Hadrian who along the canal of the Canopus valley set a portico only where it was needed to protects the diners from the sun and not on the other bank which was already shaded by the hill, would never create an underground symmetrical gallery which could be admired only on a map. Moreover the presence of a canal in the middle of the valley seems to be confirmed by a probe conducted with an auger which found a difference of 0.50 m of depth between the sides of the valley and its center.
Coming back to the small cave, this grotto is surely what Aelius Spartianus called Inferi when he wrote “etiam Inferos finxit”. The tight connection of it with the mysterious building known with different names - Elysian Fields (Ligorio), Serapis Temple (Piranesi), Pluto&amp;rsquo;s Temple (Penna) - when compared in the same scale with the Telesterion and the nearby Plutonium of Eleusis (Fig. 67) might suggest that this creation was contrived by Hadrian as a memento of the Eleusinian mysteries to which, he had been initiated, and in which he also reached the highest degree.

Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden The so-called Throne Hall garden (Fig. 1, n. 17)
Keywords flower gardens nymphaea (garden structures) peristyles (Roman courtyards) Garden Description The so-called “Throne Hall” (MACDONALD, PINTO 1995, pp. 78-81), was not a throne hall at all (Fig. 46). It was a garden (JASHEMSKI, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987-88, pp. 154-156, figs. 9-10; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1998, p. 366, fig. 2; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 325-330, figs. 111-113). A probe (Fig. 46, A), in the peristyle cleared that here there was no flooring. Another probe (Fig. 46, B), revealed instead the existence of two flowerbeds (Fig. 46, C), dug in the tufa, and enclosed by low walls of irregular blocks of stone, roughly set together by a poor mortar. Even a small flowerpot was found in the northern flowerbed (Fig. 47). By its small size and its shape, it revealed to have contained some small plant of the kind called by Pliny “viola”(Fig. 48). The garden was crossed in the middle by a central alley: a large path (Fig. 46, P) that led to a podium (Fig. 46, S) set in an ample apse. Today both these two elements are in very bad condition The remains of the apse are scarcely higher than the basis of a series of niches, which - Penna says - were decorated by chunks of pumice tinged with green and bluish hues to imitate the grottoes' rocky walls, a typical decoration for a garden nymphaeum. Today the podium, that was set in the middle of the apse, is quite wrecked. Once it must have been lined with marble but today only the concrete of its basement is left (Fig. 49).
However the presence of the podium and the fragments of the red marble suggests that all this arrangement was created to expose some particularly beautiful piece of sculpture. As a matter of fact, chunks of a red marble statue (a Faun&amp;rsquo;s tail, and a piece of a goat&amp;rsquo;s skin) have been found here. This suggests the presence of a third statue of Faun with a goat, similar to the two that have already been found at Villa Adriana. Unfortunately, the way in which the remains have been broken, and the vicinity of some kilns where many pieces of sculpture were reduced to chalk, makes us think that nothing more will be found. It is a pity, because this statue, probably brought back by the emperor&amp;rsquo;s in 125 A.D., must have been an outstanding piece of sculpture.
It is evident that this peristyle-garden was clearly designed to give a scenographic view of the masterwork (Fig. 50) to people staying in the Doric Pilasters' Hall.

Location Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Villa (Pleiades)
Location Description DESCRIPTION
Villa Adriana, erected by emperor Hadrian at the beginning of the II cent. A.D., occupies a vast area of 126 hectares. It was a beautiful estate strategically located near Tivoli and, at the same time, not very far from Rome (WINNEFELD 1895; KÄHLER 1950; AURIGEMMA 1961; RAKOB 1973; BROWN 1964). Prior to the Hadrianic settlement, an ancient villa, dating back to the late republican time, already stood there. Probably it belonged to Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s family and, as a matter of fact, many scholars think that Hadrian chose this estate as the ideal one because he already knew the place and was attached to it (LUGLI 1927). Certainly he preserved and restored the original building and made it the nucleus of his private quarters.
The realization of this magnificent residence must have been a cherished dream of Hadrian, and he must have planned it long before becoming an emperor. This is the only way to explain how the works for its construction began immediately after his election and his return to Rome in 118 A.D. Hadrian died in 138 A.D. when his ideal residence was nearly completed. Nearly, because there was still some work to be done. Some important halls of the Great Baths were not finished, and the model for a Stadium, found among the ruins of his last building-yard in the quarters of the stonecutters (CAPRINO 1996-97; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, p. 73; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 144-147), was never brought to the unknown place where Hadrian had planned to build it. The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s death put an abrupt end to all activities, and some of the gardens he planned to create, and for which fountains and pavilions had already been built, were never done or, if ever they were completed, seem to have been soon abandoned (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, pp. 000-000). As a matter of fact after him Villa Adriana was only partially lived in by his successors and was solely used for occasional visits. It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial praedia. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden The Stadium-garden (Fig. 1, n. 4) Stadium-garden at Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Villa (Pleiades)
Keywords flower gardens fountains garden pavilions nymphaea (garden structures) peristyles (Roman courtyards) piazza porticoes stadium triclinia (rooms) tufa Garden Description Already widely documented, published and discussed, it was surveyed, excavated and reconstructed by A. Hoffman (HOFFMAN 1980). His book is an outstanding and very important work but we can&amp;rsquo;t accept all of his hypotheses, and namely we can&amp;rsquo;t believe the existence of an impossible central basin (HOFFMAN 1980, p. 67, plt. 50. 1). The place, picked for it by Hoffman, is a square area where tufa is surfacing (Fig. 12, d). All the excavations put in evidence that only a thin layer of soil (10 to 5 cm high) covered the rock (JASHEMSKI, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987-88, pp. 151-154, fig. 4; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1998, pp. 383-385, fig. 14). Now it stands to reason that, if there had been a basin, it must have had a decorative coating of marble or mosaic. In this case the tufa would have been first smoothed and after that leveled with a thick layer of mortar. But there is no trace of leveling or of mortar here. The surface of the rock is irregular and left as it was in nature. It is difficult to understand how, with this kind of rocks nearly surfacing, anybody could have imagined to find the depth necessary to create a basin. How didn&amp;rsquo;t he calculate the thickness of the layer of concrete necessary to create a horizontal smooth plane, which, as the higher peaks of the rock were at 5 cm from the soil&amp;rsquo;s surface, had to be 6 cm thick at least? How didn&amp;rsquo;t he realize that, to keep the water in, he had to spread over the concrete a layer of at least 2 cm of impervious opus signinum? Then he had to cover it with another layer of mortar necessary for fixing the chosen flooring, and at last, add from 1 to 3 cm of mosaic or marble. There would never have been any place left, not even for enough water to moisten the surface.
Therefore what we find here is simply a piazza 20 m long and 23.75 m wide (Fig. 12, d). It is placed right in the middle of the so-called Stadium (Figg. 14-15), a garden which is the pivotal part of a very important tricliniar area (Fig. 13) (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987, pp. 178-180, figs. 21-28, 35-37); consisting in the Three Exedras' Hall (Fig. 12, a and e). It stood on its western side, and the overhanging Winter Palace, which rose on the opposite one (Fig. 12, b). In the Stadium, two large tricliniar pavilions (Fig. 12, c, c1) were set at the southern and northern side of the piazza (Fig. 14 and 15) (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 225-231). Due to its position, this place was conveniently set under the eyes of all the guests. It was their center of interest.
Now, for what we read about Roman everyday life, we know that, while banqueting, people used to enjoy many forms of entertainment (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1983, passim) and, from the Historia Augusta, we also know that, during his dinners, Hadrian always wanted to assist to comedies, dramas and recitals of poetry (Hist. Aug., Hadr. 25.20). Therefore it seems highly probable that this area was intended to be used as a stage, even though not a paved one, because here there are no remains of masonry. We must conclude that its soil was either covered by a layer of very fine red gravel (remains of it were found in the excavation of the Stadium-garden) or - even if there is no knowledge of the existence in ancient times of grasses kept as a kind of lawn - of a green space (Fig. 12, d).
Meanwhile on the northern end of the Stadium the area between three luxurious rooms (Fig.12, n) and the tricliniar pavilion was occupied by a small, elegant garden (Figg. 12, m; 14). Porticoes (Fig. 12, s) ran on both its sides and, in the middle, two square and long flowerbeds flanked a marble lined euripus. We can very well imagine the reflection of the architecture on its calm blue water.
On the opposite side (Figg. 12, H; 16), another garden - an emicycle - imitated the part which, in a real Stadium, was occupied by the public. Only this one was a magnificent nymphaeum (HOFFMAN 1980, pp. 000-000). A canalization, coasting the palace building, circled the top of the emicycle, and water slided from it on the white marble steps of eight small waterfalls. Amid them, hedges of box trees, neatly cut, well groomed, and set in big mortar containers, took the place of the spectators' seats. At the bottom, in a small grotto, a fountain collected the falling water, and emptied it in the nearby semicircular basin, concluding with it this splendid water-theater. A spectacular garden indeed.

Garden The terrace on the valley of Tempe (Fig. 1, n. 10)
Keywords terrace gardens Garden Description This terrace offers a splendid view of Tivoli and its mountains (Fig. 30). The concentration of lead in its soil shows that it was kept as a cultivated area (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1994-95, fig. 7). Today we don&amp;rsquo;t have enough elements to understand its landscaping, but we must consider that the terrace is set between two very important garden features of Villa Adriana. On the northern side it is flanked by the enchanting, open air pavilion now called the “Belvedere of the Venus of Cnidus” (Fig. 1, 11) while, on the opposite side of the plateau, another imposing nymphaeum, the so-called “Stallone”, concludes the esplanade overlooking the Valley of Tempe. At the back of this terrace a big sustaining wall reinforced by impressive arches ran along the West side, and this embankment was concluded by another more modest nymphaeum, set in front of the Venus of Cnidus' Belvedere. It was decorated by a series of niches which, before the ruin of Villa Adriana, might have contained some decorative elements, giving this garden its final touch. Today the niches have been disfigured opening , in each of them, windows of different shapes the ones from the others.

Africa proconsularis (Pleiades)
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.
Location THUBURBO MAIUS (Henchir Kasbat), Tunisia
THUBURBO MAIUS (Henchir Kasbat), Tunisia (Pleiades)
Location Description The city occupies the slopes of a hill in a fertile grain producing area about 50 kilometers to the south of Tunis. Originally a settlement of mercenary soldiers after the fall of Carthage, it was raised to amunicipium by Hadrian (117-138), and to a colony during therein of Commodus (177-192). The chief public buildings and the most beautiful homes date from this period. After the crisis of the Empire during the third century, Thuburbo saw a rebirth in the fourth century; but as imperial authority declined the city became a mere village.
Keywords peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes semi-circular pool reception rooms Garden Description This building, located to the NW of the Winter Baths, was comprised of three articulated sectors, the SE area, the NW area, and the area to the N of the NW area.
The SE area was laid out around an incomplete peristyle with seven columns along the NW and SW sides (Plan view, Fig. 1). Three semicircular pools projected into a large courtyard. A first pool was located at the extremity of the NW portico (II) facing the main reception room V, and there was a third of which only traces survive. The large court (I) of irregular shape (ca 24x10m) was not paved and may have been planted.

In several areas along this ancient coastline remains have been brought to light of large and sumptuous villas built on the coast, in large coves or high places, with beautiful panoramas.The remains of a villa, called by fifteenth-century visitors to the site “Grotte di Catullo”, after Verona’s poet Catullus, are situated at the northern tip of the Sirmione peninsula, on the southern bank of the Benacus(Lake Garda), the largest of the pre-alpine lakes (Fig.1). As one of the most interesting examples of Roman residential architecture in northern Italy, this villa deserves the designation of villa maritima, as other similar examples along the Campanium-Latium coast.The villa covers an area of around 20,000 square meters distributed on three terraces, which ascend the slope of the hill on a series of substructures. The building has a rectangular plan (167.5 x 105 meters), with two foreparts; on the S side at the main entrance and on the N side at the tip of the peninsula, towards which the villa faced, so as to be surrounded by the lake on three sides (Fig. 2).On the evidence of recent studies, the villa is dated to the Augustan-Tiberian period (end of the first century B.C. –start of the first century A.D.): it was constructed after the destruction of an earlier building, the existence of which has been documented in a small archaeological excavation beneath the floor of one of the rooms on the southern side of the villa. Modifications to the building, in particular the creation of the large baths area, date to the end of the first –second century A.D. The destruction of the villa came quickly, with all probability around the 3rd century: at that time the functioning of the villa seems to have stopped and no later maintenance or building interventions have been identified; a differing situation as regards the other villas in the lake Garda area, which had a continued life, with phases of great importance, up to the first half of the fifth century.The building, constructed as a whole and with axial and symmetrical criteria, is characterized by long terraces on the eastern, western and northern sides: these connect directly with the large terrace on the northern forepart, which was shaded by a veiled covering, as demonstrated by the characteristic elements which supported the posts found in this area. By the side of the terraces were long porticoes: the western one built over a double-nave cryptoporticus, which acted as a substructure, the eastern for the main part built directly on the natural bedrock. The residential rooms were distributed in the northern and southern areas, the western part of the latter being occupied by the baths complex (Fig. 3-4).While the substructures are well-preserved, the residential floor, situated on the higher level, has been subject to greater destruction over the course of the centuries, due to the systematic robbing of building materials, already started in ancient times, the collapse of part of the wall on the eastern side along the hill-side, and in the agricultural use of the land, presently occupied by a vast olive grove (Fig. 5). The villa has been excavated on several occasions from the start of the 19th century and subsequently backfilled, so that the plan and hypotheses for the reconstruction for a large part of the residential level, which has not been the object of new research in recent years, are based on the notes and drawings of the 19th century, not always reliable. Other excavations were conducted between 1941 and 1965; research aimed at defining the chronology of the building and resolving problems in the plan of several rooms in the southern area were undertaken between 1984 and 1994.The events endured by the structure render difficult and at times impossible, at present, to hypothesize the functions and characteristics of many of the residential rooms, as also with the various open spaces present within the building. Undoubtedly, other than the large peristyle (C), which occupied the central area of the building, other open spaces, now buried (courtyards or gardens), were to be found along the central N-S axis. In the southern part there was an open space (N), situated between the western part of the villa, destined as the baths complex, and the eastern part containing the living rooms. In this case, according to the interpretation of the director of the first excavations and more recently, the area functioned as a courtyard giving access and light to the rooms on its E, S and W sides. A wall divided the courtyard from the S side of the peristyle, to which direct access was possible by one or more entrances. Another hypothesis suggests that access between the two courtyards was not axial but by a side corridor, while a wall with windows would have permitted a view of the internal garden.Of the other open space (O), situated to the N, there is uncertainty as to its function. One can hypothesize, on the basis of the 19th century plans, an open space with porticoes on all four sides: perhaps another small peristyle. An element which would confirm its use as a courtyard or garden is the presence of a stone-built rainwater drain, still present in the 19th century and illustrated by Orti Manara in his publication on Sirmione. Some parts of this drain have been re-used in the walls of the Early Medieval church of San Salvatore in Sirmione. There are no precise indications for external gardens and it is only possible to hypothesize the natural setting in which the villa was situated. However it must be stated that artificial terraces had been made on the eastern side of the building, or more precisely the areas which corresponded to the N-E and S-E corners, formed by the two foreparts of the villa. In the first (H) the bedrock has been cut to a depth of around 4 meters to create a large terrace, which occupied the whole area as far as the drop in level towards the lake (Fig.6). It is interesting that the second artificial terrace (I), of more limited extension, at around 10 meters below the residential level of the villa and reached by a flight of steps, was still known in the 19th century, by ancient tradition and without apparent justification, as “the garden.”The large central open space (C), beginning from the 19th century, was identified as a courtyard-viridarium. It is formed by an area of around 4000 square meters, equivalent to about one fifth of the whole area of the villa (Fig.7). Both the 19th century excavations and more recent trenches have failed to locate the presence of structures or floors, and it is therefore possible to hypothesize that the area functioned as a garden, probably surrounded on all four sides by porticoes as indicated in the 19th century plans and supported by recent research.The present land use, with many trees, and the thin soil cover in respect to the original ground surface, no longer permit the acquisition of data to allow a more precise reconstruction of the ancient garden, its internal sub-divisions, the types of vegetation, the possible ornamentation. On the S side of the peristyle is located a large perfectly preserved underground cistern (66), of a length corresponding to the width of the peristyle (42.60 x 2.40 meters). It is covered by a herringbone floor in small bricks, 6 meters wide and around 50 meters long (fig.8). Rainwater, collected in this part of the building, flowed into the cistern through a series of lead fistulae which entered the S-E and S-W corners, as is demonstrated by holes in the floor created by the robbing of the lead pipes, of which fortunately a small part is still preserved in the S-W corner, where it enters the cistern. The floor of the cistern has a slope of 7-8% from S to N: on the northern side four channels collected rain water and allowed it to flow in an organized manner towards the garden, with a slope of 6% (fig.9). The channel was formed in the initial part by a prolongation of the herringbone brick floor, which with its tapering form towards the external area helped the entry of rainwater into the channel, which flowed beneath the ancient ground surface (Fig. 10). The channels, lined with hydraulic mortar, were excavated in the bedrock, which outcropped on the eastern side and were covered with thin stone slabs. On the opposite side they were constructed in the earth and only their lower parts are preserved, the covering and the ancient floor shaving been robbed. Given the slope of the channels, their conformation and number, it is to be excluded that they had the sole function of draining the rainwater from the brick floor, and it may be hypothesized that they also served the function of directing to the garden the water which was extracted from the cistern, perhaps for irrigation.Water was drawn from the cistern by one or more wells: in the 19th century a well-curb, which was said to have come from the area of cistern, was still preserved in Sirmione. By the side of the cut which housed one of the well-curbs, two square holes had been cut into the floor in ancient times. It is hypothesized that they held the posts for the structure supporting the ropes and vessel used to extract water from the cistern (girgillus).There are no other elements to help describe the form of the large peristyle. Two pieces which may have formed part of the decoration of the garden are composed of sculptural fragments: a head dating to the second century A.D., found in the soil inside the cistern (66), and a sundial, presently lost, but fortunately represented by a drawing. Given the location, the head must have come from the peristyle, and can be hypothesized as belonging to the statue of a Dioscuros (fig. 11). In Greek marble, it is broken at the level of the chin. The head is covered by a pilos, from which issue locks of hair, curling on the forehead and sides of the face.There are no useful clues to help reconstruct the vegetation, which may have been present in and around the villa.The climate of Lake Garda is sub-Mediterranean, determined by the notably large mass of water which tends to maintain a constant temperature, much milder than the rest of the cisalpine area. The cultivation of olives already existed in Roman times, as documented by botanical evidence from recent excavations at Sirmione and the strong spread of the plant both in the locality and the whole area around Lake Garda in the Early Medieval period. In the same manner grapes were probably also cultivated, indirectly represented by an inscription found near Sirmione (fig. 12). Probably also common in the Roman period were the native species, shrubs such as oleander and rosemary and trees such as cypress, bay, ash and several species of oak, documented in the last two examples by botanic remains found at Sirmione, recently analyzed by the Archaeobiological Laboratory of the Civic Museums of Como.

Keywords tombs epitaphs stelae grove (sacred grove) vegetable gardens Garden Description A marble slab reported at Altinum in the sixteenth century and now in Venice records, above a depiction of an axe, a plumb-line, and a tree with birds, the epitaph of L. Ogius Patroclus, who some time (probably) in the late first or second century, “following the tradition of dutiful respect maintained by the corporation of firemen, donated while still living the gardens with building adjoining the tomb, so that from their revenue roses and food would be supplied generously for his patron and, eventually, for himself” (secutus pietatem col(legii) cent(onariorum) hortos cum aedificio huic sepult(urae) {a} iunctos vivos donavit, ut ex reditu eor(um) largius rosae et esce patrono suo et quandoque sibi ponerentur). The pairing of roses for the dead and food for the living (rosae et escae) was common in Roman funerary celebrations at the grave site, which perhaps suggests that mixed planting of flowers and vegetables was common in Roman tomb gardens as well (cf. ILS 6711, 8371).

Little is known of the first nucleus of the villa, dated to 120-100 B.C. The layout that has survived dates to the second phase (80-50 B.C.). The excavated portion of the pars urbana is to the north of a large courtyard (Fig. 1: 11). On the same axis with the vestibulum and Corinthian atrium (respectively 1 and 2 in fig. 1) was a quadrangular hortus (Fig. 1:8). Most probably this garden was surrounded by porticoes. Several water canals passed through the garden and ended in Courtyard 11. In the late first century A.D. the main residential part was moved to a higher elevation, and the area of the Corinthian atrium was transformed into a bath suite. These changes affected also the hortus: the level of the area was raised, some service-rooms were built, and in the west corner was the praefurnium.. From the west corner a masonry staircase led to the granaria (Fig. 1: 9). Courtyard 11 possessed in the middle one or maybe two open air water basins. Several underground water drains crossed it, gathering rainfall waters into a main drain, which ended in the cove. Building phases dated to the third and fourth centuries A.D. did not substantially change this space distribution. The villa was inhabited until the sixth century A.D.

The “summer” quarters unfold around a U-shaped peristyle, open on the sea-side, with central garden measuring 31.8 x 26.2 m. (fig. 2: 4). No traces of a pool or fountain were found in the center of the garden. The portico, 2.40 m wide, had a mosaic floor in black tesserae with a white border. Many rooms looked into the peristyle, with the main one probably being a triclinium (Fig. 1). On the two opposite corners of this side of the courtyard were also service rooms: Room 6 was the kitchen, 15 maybe a storeroom (many amphorae were recovered, but the room had a mosaic floor). Of the rooms around the peristyle, Room 31 was the most lavishly decorated. The back wall presented a semicircular niche with a statue-base, the floor had an elaborate polychrome mosaic, and the walls were covered with marble slabs. South of the “summer villa” was a long cryptoportico, flanking a garden, no longer preserved, but known from nineteenth century archival documents. The villa was built in the first century A.D. and, at least in part, was used down to the sixth century A.D.

A corridor (a) connected this garden to a bath quarter that boasted a nymphaeum (t) and a panoramic view onto the sea. A similar semicircular portico and garden was in the villa of Anguillara Sabatia, but the radial disposition of the rooms of the ‘Villa della Terma’s’ pars urbana is unusual, revealing a desire to lend each room a view onto the garden. The preservation of this villa is poor because for centuries it was scavenged for building material. Dated material ranges from the first century B.C. (brick stamps) to the early fifth century A.D. (coins). It is possible that these remains were part of the nearby “Villa della Statua.”

It overlooked the sea to the west and had a portico at the south (Fig. 1: B), with rooms opening onto it. The main nucleus of the villa unfolded around a rectangular garden surrounded by porticoes on all four sides (the long sides measure 24.5 m.; the short ones 15.2; Fig. 1: U). A rectangular brick pool with a black mosaic pavement was in the north-east portion of the garden (Fig. 1: a). It pre-dates the portico, since it was partly destroyed by the paving of the north-east portico. A terminus post quem for the construction of the portico was determined by a coin of Nero, found inside the pool.
During nineteenth century excavations, fragments of two superimposed wall paintings were recovered in Room C. The outer layer is not well enough preserved to identify any subject, but the preserved fragments beneath show branches and leaves with colored backgrounds of light blue, red, yellow and white. It is, therefore, possible that this cycle of painting depicted a garden, echoing the view of the real plantings visible through the doorway.
North of the peristyle was the bath quarter (Fig. 1: G, H, I, M, P), but it is not completely clear how the two parts of the villa were connected. In a partially excavated Tuscan type atrium (G) with an impluvium, several fragments of a marble torso were recovered, possible from a copy of the Polykleitan Doryphoros or Diadumenos. On the west side of the villa facing the sea was a porticoed garden (Z) and large semicircular exedra (24 m in diameter). Under the mosaic floor of this exedra are traces of an earlier room (Fig. 1: a) with a mosaic floor. On axis with the center of the exedra and garden was a triclinium (6.2 x 12 m) with a black-and-white mosaic floor. Another exedra (7.5 x 15 m), with a black-and-white mosaic floor, had large windows looking to the sea, and beside it a staircase leading to the water’s edge and to a dock.

Keywords [ambulationes] triclinia (rooms) charcoal] pollen Garden Description Excavated in the later 1980s, this property features a garden, described by Ciarallo as “laid out in eight ground strips bordered by furrows.” She interprets this layout as a plant nursery, also taking into account that the root cavities throughout were small, 4-8 c. in diameter, with two larger cavities of 20 and 40 cm. The larger cavities flank the axis that divides the garden in half.
Gardens excavated recently shed light on the layout, which might, alternatively, be seen to comprise two slightly wider beds and two narrow ones that run alongside ambulationes, providing a modest strolling garden adjacent to the triclinium. Elsewhere, gardens of the time of the eruption featured a variety of plants along these rows that would have been observed and presumably admired by the stroller, either for their exotic origin or for skill in creating new varieties of unusual shapes of familiar plants.
The team made 160 casts in this garden. Pollen and charcoal were also collected and indicate the presence of grape (Vitis), hazelnut (Corylus), Prunus, Oak (Quercus), and Beech (Fagus). Beech and Oak are also seen in the pollen samples. Tree roots were interpreted as pine (Pinus) and olive (Olea).

Keywords masonry triclinia (rooms) pergolas porticoes lecti reservoirs lattices doliums Garden Description A. To the west of the Great Palaestra there was a large garden which was partially excavated in 1954-1956. A low masonry wall with planting spaces in the top enclosed an elaborate masonry triclinium (l. medius, 4.45 m.; l. imus 4.20; l. summus 3.55 m.) with a table 0.65 x 0.75 m.) on the south, west and north sides. This was shaded by a pergolas supported by four massive columns finished with stucco. Two elaborate mosaic fountains faced each other in front of the triclinium. Both fountains were an arched niche set into a rectangular façade surrounded by a pediment with a tiny arched niche in the center of the back which spewed water into the pool below. The bronze jet survived in the north fountain. Close to identical mosaics on both fountains features a panel with two fish and two ducks on the lower drum, and garden paintings on the on the east and west sides of the fountains as well as on the ends of the lectus imus and the lectus summus. Each fountain had a water reservoir built on the top with steps for access. The south reservoir was 0.63m x 1.06m, 0.45m deep and the north one was 1.10m x 1.04 m, 0.45m deep. The lead supply pipe for the north reservoir was found intact, and Dr. De Caro surmised that these reservoirs were provisional prior to the completion of the aqueduct in this area. The paintings on these two elaborate mosaic fountains were quite faded but the details that could be discerned included a yellow-orange lattice fence at the bottom of each with a fountain painted in the center of each panel surrounded by flowering shrubs, trees and birds (Jashemski, Gardens, vol. 1, fig. 261 on p.176). The east sides of the mosaic fountains were visible from the entrance from the Great Palaestra. The east side of the south mosaic had a bowl–shaped fountain with a square rim with two pigeons sitting on the rim, the one on the right drinking. A date palm stands behind this fountain with three clusters of ripe fruit. One shrub on the right appears to be an oleander with red blooms and a small brown bird perched in the branches, but the remaining plants are too faint to be identified. The fountain painted on the east side of the north mosaic fountain is footed and crater-shaped with two handles. What appear to be two herons perch on the fence facing the fountain on either side, a blue one on the left and a white one on the right. The shrubs in back have the foliage of oleanders with two small birds flying about. From the triclinium the paintings on the west side of the mosaic fountains could be enjoyed. The west side of the north mosaic fountain had another crater-shaped, two handled fountain with a low base and a black bird sitting on the fence to the right. There are traces of a date palm behind the fountain and the rest of the foliage is badly faded but there appears to be some oleanders included in the painting. The west side of the south mosaic fountain had an image of an egg-shaped, footed fountain with a golden color and some detailing to suggest that it may represent a bronze fountain. To the top of the left there remains the crown of a palm tree with a small sparrow-like bird, and although most of the plaster on the right side has fallen there is enough evidence to surmise another palm tree could have been painted here along with some oleanders.
Jashemski examined this garden in 1971 and found a series of cavities along the north wall and close to a complete planting pot (13cm high, 5cm diameter at the base, one hole in the bottom and three on the sides). The number of root cavities in the interior of the garden indicated that the triclinium was likely set in a vineyard with the usual number of trees but any evidence of the planting plan had been destroyed by the excavation truck traffic. There was a masonry altar opposite the triclinium near the west wall and a masonry pool in the northwest corner of the garden. The north couch of the triclinium had a garden painting on the east side showing a footed, bowl-shaped fountain centered behind a brown lattice fence. Two birds perch on the fountain but the foliage of the surrounding bushes is too damaged to identify. The south couch was decorated with a similar fence and some bushes. The serving table has traces of a peacock and flowering plants while the niches on the inside of the triclinium couches have some very well preserved garlands hanging between them. The low wall that enclosed the triclinium on the north had a section that survived with beautiful grape vines heavy with large ripe fruit clusters.
B. This vineyard section of the property was excavated in 1984 by Dr. De Caro. A small peristyle garden was enclosed on the east and south by a three column portico with a pilaster on the southwest corner. A low wall joined the pilaster and the west column on the south side with a terracotta puteal incorporated into it. The north and east sides of the garden had a gutter. The south part of this vineyard had a small house with a garden painting on the west wall. The excavators found the painting to be badly damaged but a section showing a lattice fence 0.68m high with leaves and flowers behind remained on the right two-thirds of the building. All of the painting above the fence had been lost. A huge lararium was built against the north portion of the wall which partially covered the image of a Frejus type statuette of Venus 0.87m high. An entrance from the east portico led directly to the vineyard which had been in production at the time of the eruption. At the front of the house on the west end a treading floor for the grapes had been built. The floor was raised, enclosed by a low wall 18 cm high, and paved with opus signinum. The juice would run into a pair of dolium buried in the soil at the east edge of the floor.

Keywords aedicules lararia strigillation triclinia (rooms) doliums Garden Description A large aedicula lararium on the east wall and a large triclinium (l. medius, 4.40 m.; l. imus 4.00; l. summus 3.80 m.; table between couches 1.00 x 1.67m.) were found in the large area attached to this humble house when excavation was started in 1953-1954. Human remains were uncovered with five gold coins, two gold rings, a strigil and seven medical instruments close to the -triclinium. Next to the shrine two terra-cotta votive offerings, a slender female winged figure (0.155 m. high; Pompeii inv. no. 10569) and a small draped figure with considerable red paint surviving on the drapery(figure (0.165 m. high; Pompeii inv. no. 10150) were found as well as a marble statuette of Hercules (ca. 0.57 high without base; Pompeii inv. no. 10138). South of the triclinium a doghouse had been built by mounting half of a dolium (0.70 x 0.50m.) on a masonry base 0.15 m. high. Further finds included a large terra-cotta funnel, but the function of this area could not be determined. Excavation by Jashemski in 1971-1972 revealed what appears to be a large commercial flower garden. Where the lapilli remained until the 1970s, the undamaged soil contours and root and stake cavities were well preserved. Circular watering depressions remained in one bed that held a small plant. Balloon photographs showed complicated bed arrangements and a path coming from the outside area to the middle of the garden where a left turn led to the triclinium and altar in front of the lararium. Fig.63, 17.7.73, Fig. 64, 8.33.73, Fig. 65, 21A.13.73 An extensive system of rain water collection and distribution had been built. Roof run off was collected in a large dolium on each side of the door and in a nearby pool. Additional water could be brought from outside sources and poured through an amphora tip in the east end of the north wall to fill a dolium](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300400601) imbedded in the northeast corner of the garden. The natural slope of the land was from north to south and the irrigation layout took advantage of this fact. When the dolium](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300400601) in the northeast corner overflowed the water ran down a channel along the east wall watering young trees planted in the channel until it fell into a second half dolium](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300400601) buried in the soil. This process would be repeated the length of the east wall and continued along the south wall. There were channels along the north and west walls and dividing all the beds in the interior of the garden. Eleven large tree root cavities were counted with dimensions of 30 cm. or more at ground level. One grew near the southwest corner of the shrine, three along the walls and seven scattered about the garden. Another huge, partially destroyed cavity about 2 m. could have been an olive tree that grew to the west of the cistern. Many other smaller tree root cavities were found, and carbonized cherries (Prunus cerasus L.) that were found here would identify at least some of these. Along the walls with the tree root cavities were terra-cotta pots similar to those found in the House of the Ship Europa (I.XV.1-3). There were well preserved vine root cavities and post cavities for the pergola over the triclinium. Most of the garden cavities that remained were for the stakes that supported the frames for the shade structures for young bedding plants. Parallel to the west wall, 3.30m away from it, a row of posts formed either a shed or an arbor with roofing support holes in the wall above. Two ancient gardening tools, a sarculum and a dolabella were found in the garden along with bones, teeth, perfume bottle fragments, and fragments of terra-cotta unguent containers. The house to this garden contained a large number of glass perfume bottles. The assessment of pollen and spores found here are shown in Jashemski (1979).

B. The small garden to the rear of house 4 had an entrance into this large open area (b) which had been planted at the time of the eruption. There was a second entrance (6) from the side street. At the time of excavation a cistern was noted in the southwest corner, a basin along the south wall just before the jog, and the presence of seven root cavities. Jashemski found a few other scattered root cavities later, but too much damage had occurred from new growth to determine the original planting plan.

Keywords amphitheaters trellises triclinia (couches) vineyards doliums Garden Description Located north of the amphitheater, this site was initially identified as the Foro Boario or Cattle Market. A small amount of excavation was started in 1755, but in 1814 the entrance and south wall were excavated. Most of the excavation was completed in the 1950s, except the northeastern section. In 1966, Jashemski undertook preliminary sub-soil excavations and proved that the area had been under cultivation. Work continued through 1968 and 1970 removing some undisturbed lapilli and consequently 2,014 vine root cavities were recorded with an equal number of stakes in that section. It was noted that ninety percent of the root cavities had a diameter ranging from 2 to 5.5 cm with the average being just under 4 cm. The total range of size was from 1 cm to 8.5 cm. The vines were spaced four Roman feet apart, trained on a rectangular framed trellis (vitus compluviata) and each vine had three or four depressions for watering at the base. Also discovered were two well preserved examples of propagation by layering. A north-south path starting from the entrance divided the vineyard into equal halves. An east-west path crossed this leading to the outdoor triclinium and two rooms where the wine was made. A third path was discovered in 1970 running parallel to the north wall. Fifteen coins were found on the third path. The paths ran under arbors and usually two root cavities were found by each of the posts that supported the arbor. Rows of trees were planted at the edge of the vineyard between the second and third row of vines and widely spaced trees grew along the paths between the first and second row of vines on each side of the paths. Other trees were scattered randomly in the rest of the vineyard. In all, fifty-eight tree cavities were found, their ground level dimension ranging from 3.5cm to 40 cm. Two carbonized olives were found as well as one bean which could indicate that vegetables were also grown under the vines. The entrance directly across from the amphitheater was designed to be an architectural part of the masonry triclinium (l. medius, 4.85 m.; l. imus and l. summus 4.50 m.; table 0.60 x 1.30m.). The entrance pillar matched the extension of the lectus imus across from it in length and width and a low masonry pedestal that was in line with the other entrance pillar sharing the same dimensions. The pedestal could have held a lamp or statuette, and the extension of the lectus summus would have been used as a table. A second triclinium (l. medius, 4.60 m.; l. imus and l. summus 4.00 m.) was unique for the pergola posts were supported by a row of amphoras broken off at the top and bottom and buried in the ground along the outside edge of the lectus summus, close to the wall of the wine making building. The entrance triclinium, and perhaps the second one where the wine was made, would have been used to serve those attending games at the amphitheater. Fifty–two bones were found here (see Jashemski, Gardens, 1:216-218 and Table A on p. 217) with evidence that they were the remains of meals. Serving meals would have been a source of additional revenue for the wine makers. Wine would also have been sold at the shop with the portico that faced the Via dell’Abbondanza that was part of this property.

Keywords drains bathhouses (water recreation structures) vestibules basins (vessels) water baths reception rooms courtyards gutters (building drainage components) atriums (Roman halls) basins (vessels) Garden Description The coastal villa was located at the east end of the Gulf of La Spezia and controlled a large fundus. Little is known of the first nucleus of the villa, dated to 120-100 B.C. The layout that has survived dates to the second phase (80-50 B.C.). The excavated portion of the pars urbana is to the north of a large courtyard (Fig. 1: 11). On the same axis with the vestibulum and Corinthian atrium (respectively 1 and 2 in fig. 1) was a quadrangular hortus (Fig. 1:8). Most probably this garden was surrounded by porticoes. Several water canals passed through the garden and ended in Courtyard 11. In the late first century A.D. the main residential part was moved to a higher elevation, and the area of the Corinthian atrium was transformed into a bath suite. These changes affected also the hortus: the level of the area was raised, some service-rooms were built, and in the west corner was the praefurnium.. From the west corner a masonry staircase led to the granaria (Fig. 1: 9). Courtyard 11 possessed in the middle one or maybe two open air water basins. Several underground water drains crossed it, gathering rainfall waters into a main drain, which ended in the cove. Building phases dated to the third and fourth centuries A.D. did not substantially change this space distribution. The villa was inhabited until the sixth century A.D.

Province Description The frontier between Numidia and Mauretania fluctuated during early the African kingdoms.

By 31 BCE, Numidia (also known as Africa Nova) was under direct Roman control, becoming attached to the province of Africa Proconsularis. Toward 194 CE, Septimus Severus detached most of the Numidia territory from the province of Africa Proconsularis, forming a special province governed from Cirta by a procurator, subordinate to the imperial legate. With the Diocletian reforms, the whole of Roman Africa (with exception of Mauretania Tingitana) constituted a single diocese subdivided into six provinces, including Numidia Cirtensis with Cirta as capital.

Province Description The frontier between Numidia and Mauretania fluctuated during early the African kingdoms. It was fixed at the river of Ampsaga during Caesar’s reign when he rewarded his ally King Bocchus, giving him part of the Numidian kingdom. By 31 BCE, Numidia (also known as Africa Nova) was under direct Roman control, becoming attached to the province of Africa Proconsularis. Toward 194 CE, Septimus Severus detached most of the Numidia territory from the province of Africa Proconsularis, forming a special province governed from Cirta by a procurator, subordinate to the imperial legate. With the Diocletian reforms, the whole of Roman Africa (with exception of Mauretania Tingitana) constituted a single diocese subdivided into six provinces, including Numidia Cirtensis with Cirta as capital.
Location Thamugadi
Thamugadi (Pleiades)
Location Description Thamugadi, now known as Timgad, was founded as a colony during by Emperor Trajan around 100 CE. The city had a checker-board plan, measuring approximately 11 hectares (27 acres) total, containing a forum with Curia, an imperial temple, and a basilica. Between the second and fourth centuries, the city expanded from its original layout. Additional temples and baths were built, and the center of the city was expanded with the construction of luxurious houses, a library, and a new market. At the end of the fourth century, bishop Optatus of Timgad, a prominent member of the Donatist church, constructed the great west basilica. During the Byzantine conquest, a fortress was erected on the water sanctuary; the original site dating to the third or fourth century.
Garden House of the Warehouse (Maison de l&amp;rsquo;entrepôt)
Keywords peristyle houses domus [semicircular basin] [pool] Garden Description This large house was laid out around two peristyles (A,B) arranged along the N S axis. The plan presents a complex layout notably in the southern part of the domus upon which the excavators did not comment thoroughly (Plan view, Fig. 1).
The S part of the domus was probably added in a latter period. It presents a peristyle (B) on which a reception room (C) projected and a series of galleries terminating with an apsidal form. The N peristyle (A) had four porticoes, the S gallery was a continuous colonnade that crossed the W and E porticoes. On the N and W, a vestibule and reception rooms opened towards the peristyle (A). A large rectangular basin oriented NS was placed on the axis of the vestibule, which projected into the courtyard. It seems that the S reception room (C) opened also toward the N peristyle (A). Along the NS axis a semi-circular basin projecting into the peristyle (B) and facing a reception room was placed in between the fourth and the fifth columns. The courtyards of the peristyles may have been planted.

Keywords mural paintings (visual works) viridarium [temple] [sanctuary] Garden Description The water sanctuary lies beneath the Byzantine fort in the Northern suburbs of the city. An inscription that was discovered during the Byzantine fort excavations enumerates the embellishments that were undertaken in 213 by the city of Timgad for the sanctuary, Aqua Septimania Felix: one of which, a bronze balustrade surrounding the spring (a pool with marble slabs of 3,6 m x 13, 60 m) and a viridarium surrounded by porticoes decorated with paintings (porticus virdiari (sic) picturis ornatas). But the central space of the vast porticoed monument discovered to the North of the fort is paved, this has lead L. Leschi, in order to explain the viridarium designation, to consider that the paintings of the porticoes were garden paintings.

Garden Funerary Grove of Q. Cervonius Chryseros
Keywords tombs stelae grove (sacred grove) altars (religious fixtures) Garden Description A small inscribed altar of (probably) the Julio-Claudian era found by Mommsen among the stones of Aquileia and now lost records on its left and right sides dedications to Dis Pater and (H)era respectively and, on its front, the name of the dedicant, a consul’s aide (acc(ensus) co(n)s(ularis)) and local sevir at Florentia, Q. Cervonius Chryseros, who built “the grove, the enclosure wall, the altars, the mound (? molem), and the seats” (lucum, maceriem, aras, molem, [s]edilia). The dedication to Dis Pater suggests a funerary context, which leads Chioffi to identify the molis as a tomb monument of some ill-defined type (perhaps an irregular mound?). A Roman soldier serving in lower Germany at Carvium (Herwen) was buried by his two heirs ad molem, “near (or at) the mound” (AE 1939, 130). The same Chryseros perhaps appears as the owner of a slave, Fausta, who in fulfillment of a vow dedicated another monument to Dis Pater at Aquileia (CIL 5.35*).

Africa proconsularis (Pleiades)
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.

THUGGA (Douga) Tunisia (Pleiades)
Location Description Annexed in 46 B.C., the Romanization of the city of Thugga that was probably a residence of the Numidian kings, was gradual but profound. It became Municipium Thuggense in 205, and was raised to the rank of a Colonia Licinia Septima Aurelia Alexandriana Thuggensesin in 261 under Gallien. Numerous buildings of this city overlooking the valley of the Ouadi Khaled, have been uncovered among them the Capitol dedicated to the Capitoline Triad in 166-67, the theater on the top of the plateau constructed under Antonius Pius, the Temple of Mercury, Fortune, Augustan Piety, Liber Pater, Concordia, Frugifer, Pluto, Saturn and the Temple of Caelestis which stands in the middle of a an olive grove. In the residential areas stands the Licinian Baths with their Palestrae and the Cyclops Baths and the Triumphal Arch of Septimus Severus set astride a street leading down the hill. Two building inscriptions (CIL VIII, 26606 and CIL VIII, 26607), dated to AD 166-169 mention a theater with a basilica, porticoes, and xystis.

It appears to date from the first half of the 3rd centur. The rooms on the ground floor were arranged around a large court, which was more than 5 m (Plan view, Fig. 1) lower than the street. A garden occupied the center of the court which is enclosed by a portico on its four sides, the columns of which, carved with plaster and connected by a balustrade ought to have supported a wooden frame. The porticos were paved with beautiful mosaics of which certain motifs are of prophylactic character. The 3 doors of the oecus open onto the W portico, in front of which between two pilasters was a semi-circular pool projecting into the garden. This basin was decorated with a mosaic representing fish today destroyed. The oecus opens on the N onto a large room in the form of a trifolium.

Keywords shrines (structures) fountains trellises Garden Description The Palaestra was crossed by Burbon tunnels in 1756-1760 and partially excavated from 1933 to 1954. Carbonized remains of large tree trunks found in the southwest corner and along the north side against the portico where they were swept by the volcanic flow indicated to Maiuri that the central area had been planted with trees similar to the central area of the Great Palestra at Pompeii. The soil was compacted, as typical of athletic fields, and no evidence of paths or beds have yet been found. A large cruciform pool occupied the center of the area. The north-south arm is 55.00 m. long, the east-west arm is 31.50 m. long, each arm is 5.80 wide and the depth is 1.00-1.10 m. at the center. A masonry base 0.95 m. square and 1.14 m. high stood at the center of the intersection and presumably held the monumental bronze fountain sculpture found in 1952 at the bottom of the pool. The statue is a five-headed serpent 2.45 m. high coiled around a tree with water jetting from the mouth of each head. On the west end of the pool there is a pilaster with a smaller jet. Two meters from the front of the enclosed portico on the north side there is a rectangular pool 3.00 x 30.00 m.; 2.35 m. deep which was proportioned the same as a swimming pool, but had been abandoned before the eruption. Close to the bottom of the pool thirty five amphoras were installed in the walls, with openings ranging from 20 to 30 cm. in diameter. These provided shelter and spawning areas for fish.

Keywords parapets podium shrines (structures) woven rim trellises Garden Description The southern edge of town was against a sharp drop to the sea. A terrace located on this drop held two shrines (a) and (b) and a series of rooms for cult activities. All of these faced on a long garden (c) 6.85 x 22.60 m. where the fragments of two large marble fountain basins were found when this area was excavated in 1939 to 1958. On the south end of the garden a parapet had a podium which could have been used as a garden seat. Garden paintings decorated the interior walls of shrine (b). The fragments that survived were enough to give an idea of what the original effect must have been. The lower part of the panel to the left of the entrance on the south is the best preserved. The base of the wall was painted with hart’s-tongue ferns, each plant separated by a trellis that was identical to the woven fence just above which must have encircled the entire room. A garden extended behind the fence and on the south wall a marble basin supported by three legs was graced by three doves perched on the rim to drink. A small date palm and flowers are nearby, including a corn poppy on the left with carefully executed foliage and flowers, two in profile and the others drawn open faced. A young palm tree and a plant with daisy-like flowers comes next and to the right of the basin there is a rosebush with blossoms very similar to the ones painted in the garden rooms of I.ix.5. The east wall appears to have had a crater-shaped fountain, and on the north wall above the large podium altar three panels each contained a garden painting. The side panels each had a young palm tree as the dominant feature in the middle, but the center panel was too damaged to determine what it contained.

Arabia (province) (Pleiades)
The history of Roman Arabia begins with the death of the Nabataean king, Rabb&amp;rsquo;el II soter, in A.D. 106. The emperor Trajan annexed the Nabataean kingdom and organized its territory within the new Roman province of Arabia Petraea that occupied a large area of northwestern Arabia, extending from the Hauran in the north, to the Negev and Sinai deserts in the west, and into the northern Hejaz in the south. The administrative district of Perea, formerly under the Herodian dynasty was also added. The provincial capital of Arabia Petraea was located at Bostra which replaced Petra as the capital of Nabataea in the last decades of that kingdom’s independence. Petra continued to function as an important cultural, political and economic center of the province for at least a century following annexation. During the early Byzantine period (4th-6th centuries CE), the major cities of the Roman era continued to flourish, and Christianity gradually became the accepted religion of the area. Petra remained an important center in the early Byzantine period when it was inhabited by a substantial Christian community and was the seat of a bishopric.
The region of Arabia Petraea is primarily a desert environment that belongs to the eastern Mediterranean weather system. Its inhabitants experienced marked seasonal contrasts with dry, hot summers and cold, wet winters. Rainfall occurs during the winter months and ranges from over 600 millimeters in the north-west to as low as 100 millimeters in the south and east of the region.

ʻIrāq al-Amīr (Pleiades)
ʻIrāq al-Amīr is located in Wadi as-Seer in the highlands above the northeastern rim of the Dead Sea, about 15 km southwest of Amman, Jordan (Fig. 1). The wadi valley was the site of the Hellenistic/Roman settlement of Tyrus that boasts a partially restored palace (Qasr al-Abd, &amp;ldquo;Palace of the Servant&amp;rdquo;) dated to the 2nd century BCE. In the hillsides behind the palace is a series of caves that were inhabited as early as the Chalcolithic period.
Garden ʻIrāq al-Amīr
Keywords aula/forecourt columbarium/dovecote palace garden reflecting pool triclinia (rooms) Late Hellenistic paradeisos/paradise garden artificial islands Garden Description This large preserved palace provides a rare glimpse of the kind of luxurious complex built by the late Hellenistic Alexandrian elite. According to Josephus (Antiquities Book 12:228-236), Hyrcanus the Tobiad was a Hellenized Jew and Ptolemaic official who had spent considerable time in Alexandria. Remains of the palace’s architecture are disposed on each of three terraces, an arrangement described by Josephus as large, open courtyards (aulae) which he adorned with vast gardens, descriptive of a paradeisos. The site has been explored by various expeditions, most recently by the Department of Antiquities of Jordan and the French Institute of Archaeology for the Near East under the direction of Fawzi Zayadine and Ernest Will. Although no garden excavations have been undertaken, the site of the palace illuminates Josephus’ description.
The west side of the uppermost terrace contains the caves described by Josephus as triclinia, with doors designed so that only one person could pass through at a time. A columbarium, a typical feature of local palaces through the Herodian period, lies at the southern end of the cliff. Other remains of the palace and earlier inhabitation on the site lie on the east side of this terrace.
The second terrace is largely unexplored but remains of a building have been noted at its southwest corner. The lowest terrace has been the focus of archaeological exploration and contains the well-known Lion Pavilion restored by Will (Figs. 2 and 3). It was once thought to be a temple and is oddly described by Josephus as a fortress. This terrace is retained by large stone dam, which may have held water from the abundant local springs (Fig. 4). The pavilion is set well above the level of the land around it, and Netzer proposes that the “moat” mentioned by Josephus was in fact a reflecting pool for the ornately carved building (Fig. 5).
Below the dam, the land drops away dramatically in a series of agricultural terraces leading to a large valley and the Jordan Valley beyond. The complex was unfinished at the time of Hyrcanus’ death in 169-68 BCE, and the complex eventually came into the properties of Herod the Great.

Stuccoed brick columns and a low wall 0.50 m. high enclosed the central area (b) and a large gutter collected water from the edges and conducted it to the cistern. A rectangular pool ca. 2.60 x 5.00 m. with the inside painted blue was located in the center of this area. At the rear of the pool an area paved with bipedales (tiles two feet long) covered the cellars below with an opening 1.70 x 2.20 to provide light. Jashemski noted that the paved and planted areas were reconstructed with a lattice fence between them, although she did not know of any evidence to support this interpretation.

The excavation of this house in 1934-1936 revealed an unusual atrium arrangement, which Maiuri states is the first time the architectural scheme that is used in a peristyle was stylishly applied to the atrium. The atrium had no fauces, there were three columns on both the north and south sides, and on the west side there were two engaged columns with two freestanding columns between them forming the entrance and supporting the room above. A collection of marble oscilla was uncovered here, second only to the collection found in the House of the Golden Cupids in Pompeii. The tondi, peltae, and pinakes were hung between the columns against the background of glossy red walls. Various Dionysiac and theater themes, satyrs, maenads, Pan, theater masks, an amorino, a sea horse and a sea panther were the subjects featured on the oscilla. The impluvium was enclosed by a low wall with a planting space on the top providing a garden atmosphere to the atrium. A marble puteal was located on the west side of the impluvium.

Casa del Tramezzo di Legno The excavation of this house was begun in 1869-1875, but the excavation of the garden and restoration of the house was completed in the time period from January 1928 to December 1929. A wide opening on the west offered a view of the garden from the triclinium(b) directly across the way. A narrow storeroom (c) on the south had a small loggiasupported by slender columns overhead which provided a view down into the garden. The south garden wall was decorated with a garden painting. A combination of the painting’s poor condition and the artist’s strange sense of perspective caused difficulty ininterpretation. The typical lattice fence would appear to recede to form an apse for the fountain, however the lattice is painted over the fountain, a robust bowl-shaped affair, making it appear neither in front nor in back. An arbor was perhaps included,but the plaster was extensively damaged in this area. The birds were unusual, a small light colored bird perched on the right rim of the fountain was unable to be identified and on each side of the fountain at the base was a large sleepy duck (Anas sp.).A small slender heron on the right is picking at a snake. Beyond the fence various indistinct shrubs are painted on a yellow background. Between the two east pillars of the north wall the cisternmouth received water collected by the gutter which ran around the perimeter of the garden.

By the time of the eruption it had been filled with soil and converted to a small garden (a). During this change an aedicula was built on a high podium against the back wall, decorated with mosaic and shells, and garden paintings were added to the light well walls. The walls on the east and south had panels framed on the top and sides with a wide red band and a smaller black one inside. The south wall had panels on both sides of the mosaic aedicule, and of all the panels, the left panel of the south wall was the best preserved, although the GARDENS OF THE ROMAN EMPIREITALIA2center third is missing. In this panel the lattice fence is evident and a tympanumis suspended form the center of the top. This panel also has traces of what could have been a trellised pergola just to the left of the aedicula. The garden in the background is filled with densely planted bushes and a bird is perched on a branch on either edge of the panel. A masonry base was uncovered in the pool which had at one time supported a fountain jet or statuette. The excavation was begun in 1830-1831, resumed in 1869-1871, and completed in 1927. The niche of the aedecula shrine was decorated with a cluster of acanthus leaves with a female face in the center. A small roof was set in the wall to protect the painting and above this was a marble relief of an amorino flying to the left carrying a filled money purse. An iron grate was built over the top of this light well to prevent intruders from gaining access from the neighbor’s roofs. To the north was an apsed room which gained light and air from this area.

The more elegant dwelling to the south had a long corridor on one side of the large triclinium leading to a small paved courtyard with pillars (e) which supplied light and air to the house. The pillars on the south and east stood on a low wall, 0.80 m. high, with a planting area 15 cm. wide in between. This gives the area the feeling of window boxes placed below large windows. There was a well in the southeast corner of this courtyard which received rain water and beyond the courtyard was a secluded alcove. This consisted of an apsed room preceded by a procoeton.

Keywords sacella porticoes opus reticulatum Garden Description 539.III.17. At the rear of this small house there was a courtyard with an impressive brick altar against the rear wall. Maiuri felt this was probably a roofed area which would have been a sacellum. This area was excavated in 1927-1929 and may have held a few potted plants.
540.III.19-18/1-2 Because it was one of the largest houses in Herculaneum commanding a fine view of the Bay, it was initially thought that this residence was a hotel when it was excavated between the years of 1835 to 1855. The large garden (a) was also mistaken for a poultry yard but the discovery of the carbonized trunk of a pear tree (Pyrus communis L.) would indicate this area could have been planted in fruit trees. A portico surrounded the garden eight steps (1.10) above the garden level while the gutter ran one step below the portico and at each corner there was a shallow square basin for purifying the household water. The gutter conveyed the rain water to a cistern below the two wells, the openings of which were located between the columns in the middle of the east and west walls. A low masonry wall of opus reticulatum which went between the columns was a later addition. The garden was entered by way of masonry steps in the center of the south side.

Keywords porticoes Garden Description 541.IV.1-2 A windowed portico surrounded this garden (a) on the north, south and west. The east side was bordered by a narrow corridor which Maiuri proposed had glass in woodenframes set on the outside edge of the low wall. This wall had a planting space 0.16 m. wide in the top next to where the windows were set, creating a greenhouse environment. This luxurious house had an exedra(b) opening onto the center of the corridor and looking into the garden, which was slightly lower. On the oppositeside,the walls, columns, and the door posts were decorated with paintingsof shrubs, grapevines, ivy andoleander in flower as a continuation of the garden proper. A gutter circled the perimeter of the garden except by the entrance on the south, which was directly across from the grand triclinium-oecus(c). A rectangular marble-edged pool in the center of the garden had a water jet which could be viewed from either the exedra or the triclinium. The excavations in this garden in 1929-1930 uncovered a spherical white marble sundial. The triclinium-oecus opened to the south onto a long covered portico with an open terrace (d) beyond that looking out over the Bay. Potted plants most likely were placed here.

The earliest excavations of Herculaneum were done with underground tunnels. Several of these crossed this site and were discovered sixty three years later when further excavation of this patrician house was conducted in1828-1835. Eight brick columns and one engaged column stood on each of the long sides of the portico that bounded the large peristyle garden (a) on the east, north, and west sides. The north side was supported by four more columns and at the two front corners there was a pillar with an engaged column on each side. In the center of the north side two smaller pillars with one engaged column each framed a garden view from the triclinium. All the supporting members were coated with fine stucco. Gutters ringing the garden conveyed rain water to the cistern.
534.II.2. B. A second peristyle garden was located to the west of the first, but has only been partially excavated. It has stuccoed columns and pillars joined by a wall 0.4 m. high painted with plants and flowers.

A masonry planting bed on the north, east and south walls (0.32 m. high, 0.25 m. wide) was shortened on the south to leave room for the cistern puteal that stood in the southwestern corner. A podium (0.60 x 0.90 m.;) 0.55 m. high against the middle of the east wall with a niche in the wall above it was thought by Boyce to be an altar. Above the planting bed, traces of garden paintings could be seen. The only records of these paintings are reports from those present at the time of excavation. Mau relates that the paintings consisted of a lattice fence with plants above. There were two openings depicted in the fence on the on the east wall, the one on the left 0.95 m and the one on the right 1.15 m. Each opening had plants and a vessel, the one on the left was bottle-shaped and silver colored and the one on the right was goblet-shaped and gold colored. Jashemski notes that these vessels probably represented fountains. Sogliano commented that the garden had representations of xenia.

The major part of the garden was occupied by the masonry triclinium (l. medius, 3.00 m.; l. imus and. summus 2.69 m.) with a round table (0.65 m. dia.) and a lectus imus that had a fulcrum. The masonry couch had three large holes that may have received the posts for the pergola, and a marble leopard’s head fountain was found in the first room to the right of the entrance. The large window in the triclinium offered a fine view of the garden.

A cistern had been walled up and the garden was built over the cistern mouth and a paved courtyard. Water from the neighbor’s roof (no.13) supplied the cistern. The east and south walls once had garden paintings, and from the entrance the garden could be viewed through a window in the tablinium. The painting on the east wall was visible from the entrance and continued not only on the south wall but additionally on the pillar to the northeast. According to the excavator’s reports the painting had a lattice fence at the base with a variety of tall, bushy plants and birds throughout. There was a marble basin with a bearded sphinx above, reposing with the profile turned to the left. At the extreme left of the east wall was a niche that most likely had been a lararium (Fig.25, 48.1.61).

Africa proconsularis (Pleiades)
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.

UTICA (Utique) Tunisia(Pleiades)
Location Description Her geographic situation made of Utica one of the oldest and well-known Phoenician settlements. In 146 B.C, Utica became the capital of the newly created province of Africa and the residence of the governor. With the triumph of Caesar and the resurgence of Carthage, Utica&amp;rsquo;s supremacy would gradually decline under the empire. In 36 B.C. it became a municipium and a colony under Hadrian.
The city was laid out on a grid plan. Numerous buildings have been uncovered, among them the forum, several temples and baths, an amphitheater, a circus, and opulent houses. Many of these buildings of the Republican period were, during the imperial era, replaced by others larger and more luxurious. This explains the existence of two theaters for example, the one fitted into the side of the hill, the other built in open country. Enormous cisterns were constructed, fed by an aqueduct. Still extant on the summit of the acropolis overlooking the town, is a quadrangular edifice habitually referred to as “the citadel,” which could perhaps be simply a water tower.

Garden House of the Cascade (Maison de la Cascade)
Keywords masonry triclinia (rooms) baroque cascade Garden Description This house, the largest in the insula II (lots 2,3,8,9,10), was given its present form in the second century. A large peristyle with elaborate viridarium dominated the S part of the house (Plan view, Fig.1). The large shallow pool in the center of the garden occupied a rectangular area that was largely filled by a huge marble-faced masonry construction with semicircular and rectangular niches that gave the pool a baroque shape. The marble-faced construction probably held an important sculpture. Water from the fountain jet spilled from the marble-lined channel cut into the base and then spilled into the pool. The sundial, today at the edge of the base of the pool, is not in its original position.
Extending into the garden from the two central columns on the N was a semicircular pool (which faced the large room (XXXIV), decorated with a well preserved mosaic showing an Eros fishing from a boat, surrounded by fish and other sea animals. A wide entrance on the E side of the garden led through the portico to the handsome triclinium, by far the largest room in the house.
Opening off of the triclinium to the S was a smaller area enclosed by a portico on three sides. The dominant feature was the shallow square basin (1.92x 1.2 m) decorated with a fish mosaic and the adjacent mosaic panel from which the house is named. In the cascade panel, two fishermen are pulling in a vast net full of fish and sea animals. The soil on each side of the cascade was probably planted.

THYSDRUS (El Jem) Tunisia(Pleiades)
Location Description Thysdrus is located on the western border of the Sahel at 60 km S of Hadrumetum on the road leading to Sfax. The development, from the end of the 2d c., of its olive plantations and its trade in oil made the fortune of the city.
The name appeared for the first time in the period of Caesar&amp;rsquo;s African campaign when the city, at the time a small town, took side with the Pompeian and Juba against Ceasar. Towards the end of the 2d c. it became a municipium, competing with Hadrumetum for the second place in the province. The decline of Thysdrus began when, involved in a political crisis, the city choose the side of Gordian proconsul of Africa against the Emperor Maximianus. The joint effects of the political disgrace and the economic crisis, which resulted from it, brought an end to its development. By the end of the IVth century it was scarcely mentioned by the Catholic and Donatist bishops.
Among the most remarkable monuments of the ancient city are the best preserved large amphitheater in Africa, the small amphitheater located some 7.20 m to the S of the large one, the circus better visible on an aerial photography, the baths covering a surface of 2400 sq., and the residential district bounded on the S by a necropolis and to the E by a fine street.

A rectangular aedicula with four columns facing the oecus (XXXVII) extended in the garden on the W.
Two lararia (32 B, XXXV) open off of porticos XI and XIII respectively.

Africa proconsularis (Pleiades)
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.
Location THYSDRUS (El Jem) Tunisia
THYSDRUS (El Jem) Tunisia(Pleiades)
Location Description Thysdrus is located on the western border of the Sahel at 60 km S of Hadrumetum on the road leading to Sfax. The development, from the end of the 2d c., of its olive plantations and its trade in oil made the fortune of the city.
The name appeared for the first time in the period of Caesar&amp;rsquo;s African campaign when the city, at the time a small town, took side with the Pompeian and Juba against Ceasar. Towards the end of the 2d c. it became a municipium, competing with Hadrumetum for the second place in the province. The decline of Thysdrus began when, involved in a political crisis, the city choose the side of Gordian proconsul of Africa against the Emperor Maximianus. The joint effects of the political disgrace and the economic crisis, which resulted from it, brought an end to its development. By the end of the IVth century it was scarcely mentioned by the Catholic and Donatist bishops.
Among the most remarkable monuments of the ancient city are the best preserved large amphitheater in Africa, the small amphitheater located some 7.20 m to the S of the large one, the circus better visible on an aerial photography, the baths covering a surface of 2400 sq., and the residential district bounded on the S by a necropolis and to the E by a fine street.

UTICA (Utique) Tunisia(Pleiades)
Location Description Her geographic situation made of Utica one of the oldest and well-known Phoenician settlements. In 146 B.C, Utica became the capital of the newly created province of Africa and the residence of the governor. With the triumph of Caesar and the resurgence of Carthage, Utica&amp;rsquo;s supremacy would gradually decline under the empire. In 36 B.C. it became a municipium and a colony under Hadrian.
The city was laid out on a grid plan. Numerous buildings have been uncovered, among them the forum, several temples and baths, an amphitheater, a circus, and opulent houses. Many of these buildings of the Republican period were, during the imperial era, replaced by others larger and more luxurious. This explains the existence of two theaters for example, the one fitted into the side of the hill, the other built in open country. Enormous cisterns were constructed, fed by an aqueduct. Still extant on the summit of the acropolis overlooking the town, is a quadrangular edifice habitually referred to as “the citadel,” which could perhaps be simply a water tower.

The peristyle garden had a semicircular basin extending from the two middle columns on the S side, facing the triclinium (XVII) during the first century AD (Plan view, Fig.1). When the house was substantially altered in the second century the enlargement of the curb on the adjoining well destroyed half of the basin. At the same time the oecus was subdivided into several rooms, courtyard was paved.

At the northeast corner stood a lava puteal with a gutter that ran around the edges of the garden. In the center of the garden a wooden triclinium was shaded by a pergolas supported by four columns. The nails and the imprint of the wooden structure of the triclinium were clearly preserved. A marble faced rectangular pool, with an apse-shaped extension to the north and a fountain jet, was located in front of the triclinium. This pool was connected to a smaller marble basin between the couches of the triclinium. An excellent view of the garden was afforded from the large salon at the rear of the tablinum with two columns at the entrance of the portico. The oecus also opened on the north portico with a fine view of the garden and the loggia above had a view of the garden as well as views to the sea and the Lattari Mountains.

Garden Description A. This house was made by combining several small houses. The upper garden had an unusual portico on the north with various diameter columns, plastered and painted red, and two pillars. A third column on a square base supported an extension of the portico, which was a step lower and formed by an extension of the vestibule at entrance 12. The triclinium, tablinum, and exedra on the upper level of the portico were protected from cold and rain by some sort of screen installed between the columns and the west pillar. Most scholars surmise these were wooden but Maiuri proposed that they were glass, although he did not find any glass fragments during excavation (window panes surviving from this period from other sites are on display at the Museo Archaeologico in Naples and in the deposito at Pompeii).
Two steps below the portico was the garden. The back wall had a large animal painting and a small aedicules with a semicircular niche. A relief of Dianna and two deer adorned the front and inside a bronze statuette fountain of Pomona (0.38 m. high; Mus. Naz. inv. no. 144 276) stood holding a bivalve shell filled with fruit. Water jetted from the shell, down four marble steps and into the small square pool] below. A marble covered channel divided the lectus medius of the triclinium in two parts and carried the water to a small jet in the center of the low triclinium table. Four large columns supported a vine-covered pergola that shaded the triclinium]. The soil near the columns had root cavities, as reported by Maiuri, but no further details were recorded.
This was the best preserved triclinium] (l. medius, 4.60 m.; l. imus and l. summus 4.40 x 0.88 m.) in the entire city. Each couch had a marble faced step along the top, and on the sides of the triclinium] was painted a series of Nilotic scenes. There were two complete paintings while the rest of the work comprised a continuous frieze. These scenes depicted Egyptian life that revolved around the periodic inundation of the Nile. Activities pictured included men fishing, a woman spinning under a canopy, worshipers visiting shrines (some shrines in enclosures, some with extensive gardens), banquet scenes, an erotic scene in a caupona, and a pigmy slave driving a coclea (water screw).
Attached to each of the north columns of the pergolas was a low column (1.00 m. high) which most likely served as bases for statuette. In front and a little to the west of the lectus summus was a large masonry base (0.93 m. high; 0.685 m. in dia.) where Maiuri surmised that the famous bronze statue of the Ephebe stood. This statue (1.49 m. high; Mus. Naz. inv. no. 143 753) had been made into a gilded lamp stand holding candelabra brackets and was found in the atrium where it had been wrapped and placed for protection against the impending disaster. At either end of the portico was an additional pair of low circular bases for statuettes. Four broken marble statuettes were found in the triclinium] where they most likely were brought for protection or perhaps for repair after the earthquake. A statuette of Pan holding a fruit-filled calathos on his left shoulder and a ram’s head in his right hand (0.60 m. high with base; Pompeii inv. no. 3682) was reconstructed from nineteen fragments. The white marble piece had been completely gilded. There was also an inebriated satyr of white marble, (the head was missing) sprawled on a gray marble rock and opening a wineskin (0.32 m. long; 0.27 m. high with base; Pompeii inv. no. 3684). Only the necklace, bracelet, and several other details were gilded on this piece. A completely gilded statuette of a deer suckling a fawn (0.35 m. long; 0.22 m. high; Pompeii inv. no. 3683) and the remains of a gray marble base with white marble goat feet of Pan standing on a scabellum, the typical instrument of satyrs (0.28 m. long; 0. 105 m. high; Pompeii inv. no. 3685) were found there. There were also four vulgar silver-plated statuettes of placentarii or pastry vendors (each with base, 0.255 m. high; Mus. Naz. inv. nos. 143 758, 143 759, 143 761, 143 761 bis). Each carried a silver tray which Maiuri surmised were used to hold food delicacies served at dinner parties in the garden triclinium]. The statuettes as well as the delicacies were found stored together in the house. A trellis fences (site elements) separated the triclinium] from the eastern part of the garden. The trellis was supported by four slender marble posts and on top of these were four small sculptured heads (herms). These pieces were: an archaic style head of Zeus rendered in white marble (0.19 m. high) with traces of bright colors, an archaic bust of Hera (0.135 m. high), a head of a woman (0.145 m. high) carved in yellow marble, and a Bacchic head of a child made from red marble. A plain round table and a curved marble seat were found in the center of the garden. The excavation revealed soil arranged in furrows, as customary for vegetable gardens, and root cavities of small plants. Water was supplied to the garden by way of overflow channels from the triclinium] fountain. A basin, with two terra-cotta openings which would regulate the flow of water to either half of the garden, was located at the edge of the garden. The south wall at the rear of the triclinium] once had a large hunt scene, but the only surviving part was the lower register. To the left of the aedicules fountain the images of a large deer and a bird remain, and to the right a bull flees from an unidentified attacker. A feline is crouched under a large tree in the lower right and other trees are sketchily depicted in the background.
B. This peristyles (Roman courtyards) garden was entered by way of seven steps from the garden of the House of the Ephebe. This part of the building had once been a separate house (19). A portico supported by seven columns, two of them engaged, enclosed the garden on the north and part of the east side. The columns were plastered masonry, painted white on the top and red on the bottom and each had a rectangular hole, 1.70 m. from the bottom, on the side in line with the other columns. It is speculated that these were for wooden beams that held privacy screens or mats which would shield the garden area from heat and cold. The intercolumniation in front of the exedra did not have these holes, as it offered a fine view on the garden. A lead pipe with a tap directed water from the garden above into a dolium near the corner column. The pipe attached to the column had been shaped to resemble a snake fountain. Nearby a cistern collected water from the channels on the portico roof and a puteal was located on the top of the cistern. East–west furrows were preserved in the soil and the south, west and part of the east wall of the garden had garden paintings. Two large niches were located in the north wall of the portico east of the garden steps and there was an arched niche in the west wall of the north portico. In the exedra off the north portico a broken herm of Dionysus (0.12 x 0.19), was found, which was possible a garden decoration. The walls of this peristyles (Roman courtyards) garden were painted with very fine garden paintings on part of the east wall and the other three sides. Slender painted columns complete with painted garlands suspended between them, created the appearance of extending the portico and divided the walls into panels. The excavators found the paintings had been badly damaged, the best preserved was the north panel on the west wall. This showed a slender marble crater- fountain on a decorated column standing in a semi-circular niche formed by a low lattice fence. A photograph taken at the time of excavation shows that behind the fence the bushes represented were myrtles with an oleander on the right. In the background there was a date palm with lower leaves trimmed and new growth showing. This palm was flanked by two laurel trees (Laurus nobilis L.). Various birds occupied the thickets and there was a bird perched on the fence, one on the rim of the fountain and one on one of the garlands. The center panel next to this was partially preserved and what remained was the painting of a shallow, round, bubbling fountain supported by three legs located in a three sided niche formed by the lattice fence. Again there were myrtles behind the fence with a slender cypress on the right. Traces of a date palm remain in the center background. The center of the south wall was occupied by a statuette of Venus standing on a circular base, although this had to be deduced from the part of the painting which survived, which only went knee high on the statue. A fragment of a narrow animal painting survived on the west wall above a garden painting.
C. Behind the tablinum, and seen from the entrance (no. 19), a small light well served as a garden. It was painted to represent a garden and the floor had been paved. The only surviving images were the usual fence with faint traces of oleander bushes and birds. Further traces indicated that a statuette of Venus standing on a marble base in an apsed niche in the lattice fence may have been represented on the east wall. The lattice fence on the north wall was painted to represent a rectangular niche. Water was piped from the garden above through the lower part of the rear wall and possible supplied a jet in the middle of the impluvium, as surmised by Maiuri.

Garden Description One step above the level of the triclinium of this small house with an irregular floor plan was a peristyles (Roman courtyards) garden. It was to the west of the atrium and enclosed on the north and east by a portico. Five columns supported the portico and two engaged columns on the west wall continued the order of the peristyles (Roman courtyards). A large tree root cavity (the cast measures 0.80 x 0.82) indicated that the garden was well shaded and nail holes in the wall would suggest that vines had been trained to grow in that area. A large window located in the room to the west gave a view into the garden. A puteal was located over the cistern opening in the northwest corner of the peristyles (Roman courtyards) and another puteal was additionally found in the garden as well as a cartibulum (tables) decorated on one side with lions heads and a small circular base most likely used for a statuette. A lararia] on the west wall consisted of an aedicules façade with an arched niche.

Keywords atriums (Roman halls) fences (site elements) fountains mural paintings (visual works) piscinae Garden Description A very small garden was located in the light well at the rear of the atrium. The small raised garden (about 0.50 m. high) had a tiny semicircular pool fed by roof water. Three marble bases (0.16 x 0.21 m.) were most likely place at the edge of the pool. A garden painting adorned the wall behind pool. This was the painting of a garden fence and a slender, footed fountain before it. The water jets have attracted a peacock and two small birds that are perched on the rim. The elaborate plant motif on the foot of the fountain suggested to Maiuri that the artist was depicting a bronze fountain rather than a marble one. A dense thicket painted behind the fence has small fruit, the blossom ends are clearly visible, with white myrtle blossoms mixed with the foliage. Jashemski differs with Maiuri’s description of this as an oleander thicket with blossoms and berries; as she points out that oleander has elongated pods as opposed to round berries. The east wall was yellow with plants painted on it, but only the north panel survived, and nothing remains of the work on the west and north walls.

Garden Description A. A passageway from the atrium led to a modest peristyles (Roman courtyards) garden visible through a window in the rear wall. A low wall enclosed the garden on the north and east sides along with five brick columns covered with white stucco and a pillar supporting the roof of the portico. A large, well preserved wall painting survived on the west wall of the north portico as well as a niche lararium decorated with a painted bust of Mercury. From the garden a flight of stairs led down to an elegant cryptoporticus(underground portico) illuminated by light from the adjacent garden through high windows. A solarium terrace, or loggia, overlooking the large garden could be reached by another flight of stairs form the east portico.
B. At the rear of the house, a large enclosed garden had been increased in size by reducing the wings of the cryptoporticus. The last owner had built a spacious loggia (5 x 20 m.) above the north wing of the cryptoporticus overlooking the garden. A high wall joined the five pillars and the roof supporting pilaster and formed windows into the garden. At the west end of the loggia was a masonry triclinium with side couches, each having a fulcrum (foot), (l. medius 4.41m.; l.summus and l. imus 4.68 m.; dia. of table 0.55m.). A large area was left open for tables or dancers, suggesting to Spinoza that this could have been a public gathering place. There were low seats in front of the side couches and extended along the terrace walls that may have been intended for children according to Soprano. A kitchen was located on the north side of the loggia. Six steps from the southeast corner of the loggia led up into the garden which had been raised to the level of the windows in the cryptoporticus. Della Corte thought that this garden had been used to raise many cabbages and leeks. The remains of eleven victims of the volcanic eruption were found in the garden.

This tannery was excavated in 1873-1874. The peristyles (Roman courtyards) courtyard had a portico to the north and east supported by brick pillars which had been most likely been built when the original house was converted to a tannery. Against the west wall there was a masonry triclinium (l.medius 4.99 m.; l.summus and l.imus 4.96 m.; table, 1.78 x 0.93 m.). The top of the triclinium table held the famous mosaic of a skull (0.45 x 0.50 m. Mus. Naz. inv. no. 109 982;; Reusch no. 163). The mosaic representing the Epicurian philosophy features a large skull over a butterfly on a wheel representing the soul and time. On either side of the skull are the possessions of both the rich and poor with a plumb line hanging over the skull indicating the equalizing power of death. The northeastern part of the courtyard was a rectangle, the north side of which was formed by the three first intercolumniations counting from the northeast corner of the north portico, and the east side by the first two intercolumniations counting from the same corner. This area was paved with opus signinum. The little area around the triclinium between the paved area and the west wall was believed to be a garden according to Mau.
B. The south half of the insula was also excavated in 1873-74. It was accessed from the back door in the peristyles (Roman courtyards)] garden of the tannery by descending six steps. This was a large open area that had been cleared of previous structures. Formerly there had been five doors in the south wall leading to the pomerium but these were closed up. This area could have been used as a kitchen garden as suggested by Tatiana Warscher or for drying leather as suggested by Viola.

It was not until 27 B.C., however, that Augustus formally organized the Roman province of Achaea.

The provincial capital was Corinth. Under Nero in the mid-1st century A.D. Epirus became a separate province, and in the mid-2nd century Thessaly was detached and added to the province of Macedonia. Under Roman domination many cities such as Athens, Sparta, Patras, and Corinth grew in size and prominence, the latter two partly owing to their importance as ports. After an initial decline in the number of rural sites in the early Empire, by the late Roman period the countryside was densely settled with farms and villas, due to changing landholding patterns and Roman improvements in agricultural and irrigation technology. The main exports from Achaea were wine, particularly from the northern Peloponnese, as well as olive oil and honey, linen and woollen textiles and marbles.

Garden Guest House II
Keywords Archaeological peristyles (Roman courtyards) Garden Description In the first third of the 3rd century A.D. another guest house, so-called Guest House II (B on plan), was built at Olympia, immediately east of and connected with Guest House I (see Fig. 1). Guest House II was almost certainly built to supplement Guest House I after alterations to the latter resulted in its loss of the peristyle courtyard and garden. Guest House II was built with a peristyle courtyard, and its design is very similar to the one in the earlier Guest House I. In the center of the courtyard was an unpaved, and possibly planted, rectangular island surrounded by a water channel (G on plan). Both guest houses were badly damaged in the late 3rd century and only partially used thereafter until their abandonment in the 4th century.

Keywords Archaeological bathhouses (water recreation structures) peristyles (Roman courtyards) Garden Description A Roman guest house of the 2nd century A.D., so-called Guest House I, was erected southeast of the Roman Kladeos baths of ca. 100 A.D. (Fig. 3, A on plan). The guest house had a peristyle courtyard with a water-filled channel surrounding a rectangular island. The island may have been planted as a garden, since this area was not paved. Around 220/230 A.D. the guest house was altered. At this time, the building was given direct access through a corridor to the Kladeos baths. The peristyle courtyard of the guest house also was reduced in size and paved with terracotta slabs (C on plan), suggesting that the garden was no longer maintained.

Garden Leonidaion
Keywords Archaeological artificial water channels planting beds quatrefoils Garden Description This building southwest of the temple of Zeus was the largest guest house in the sanctuary at Olympia. The original Leonidaion, a gift of Leonidas from Naxos, was built shortly after 338 B.C. with a central courtyard. In the 2nd century A.D. the building was remodeled, and this courtyard was transformed into a veritable water garden (Fig. 1). The garden consisted of an outer quatrefoil island surrounded by a water channel (stippled on plan), and in the middle of this island was another circular one around which ran a second water channel (stippled on plan). On the quatrefoil island were planting beds (b on plan) in the middle of the four sides and sculptures in each of the rounded corners. This island could be reached by a bridge spanning the outer channel on the north and south sides. The central circular island was not accessible by such bridges. During the earthquake in the late 3rd century, the building was badly damaged and not rebuilt in this form.

Garden House of Nero
Keywords Archaeological artificial water channels atriums (Roman halls) peristyles (Roman courtyards) Garden Description This house was built at the time of, and possibly for, the emperor Nero, who, on several occasions in the mid-1st century A.D., performed personally in the games at Olympia. To enable the construction of the building just south of the stadium, the earlier east baths were demolished. The house had a peristyle courtyard (G on plan), measuring 14 x 17 m., that was reached after passing through the atrium in the west. In the courtyard was a distinctive decorative feature (Fig. 1). This consisted of a water channel one meter wide around the edges of the courtyard that could only be crossed by a bridge on each of the four sides. The lack of paving in the area encircled by the water channel suggests that the courtyard may have been planted. The building was partially torn down in the early 3rd century to make way for a Roman bathhouse.

Keywords Literary Pausanias sacred groves plane trees (Platanus orientalis) wild olives (Olea oleaster) Garden Description The extensive sanctuary at which Panhellenic athletic games took place, was situated on the Alpheus river in groves of trees of ancient date. In early Greek mythology, the semi-divine Herakles was said to have planted trees in the sacred precinct, called the Altis, at Olympia (Pindar, Olympian Odes 3.13-18, 23-26, 31-34). In the 2nd and 3rd centuries A.D., Roman visitors to the site could still see the groves of wild olives and plane trees (Pausanias 5.10.1, 5.13.1, 5.15.3; Philostratos, Imagines 2.6.1). In the Roman period, imperial patronage and the resuscitation of the games prompted the erection of several new buildings along the banks of the Kladeos river, in particular guest houses, for the many visitors and tourists.

Garden Sanctuary of Zeus
Keywords Literary Archaeological Pausanias archaeobotany cypress (wood) cypresses (Cupressaceae) pits (earthworks) sacred groves Garden Description The grove of trees at the temple of Zeus is known through Pausanias’ description of it (2.15.2) and from archaeological excavations in the temple precinct. Excavations in the 1970s uncovered 23 planting pits cut out of the living rock on the south side of the temple (Fig. 1, gray circles on plan). The pits were up to 2 m. in diameter and on average 65 cm. deep. Some of the tree pits were cut in relatively straight alignment with each other, but the overall impression is one of a rather loose arrangement. According to Pausanias, the trees were cypresses. This was confirmed by the excavators who found carbonised remains of cypress wood at the bottom of the planting pits. The archaeological context of the planting pits suggests that the trees were planted in the 5th or 4th century B.C., and indeed literary references of the late 5th century B.C. allude to them (Euripides, Hypsipyle, Prologue lines 99-104; preserved in a papyrus fragment of 2nd-3rd century A.D.). Trees were obviously still standing in the 2nd century A.D. when Pausanias visited Nemea.

Garden Victory Monument of Augustus
Keywords Literary Archaeological altars (religious fixtures) friezes (ornamental areas) orchards pedestals Strabo tropaeum (monument) Garden Description The tropaeum of Nicopolis, a monument celebrating the naval victory of Octavian over the joint forces of Anthony and Cleopatra at Actium, is situated on the so-called Sacred Hill of Apollo north of the ancient city. On this hill, according to ancient sources, Octavian camped during the crucial days before the battle on August 29, 31 BCE (Dio Cassius 51.1.3; Suetonius 18.2, 96.2; Plutarch, Antonius 65.3; Philip of Salonica, Anthologia Palatina 6.236).
At the foot of the hill is the suburb of Nicopolis which hosted the Actian Games, the site of a now ruinous stadium and gymnasium. Strabo describes the district as a sacred grove, saying the games took place every four years on the hill and in the gymnasium and a stadium below it (7.7.6). It is not clear from his description whether the sacred grove was a pre-existing natural one, or whether the plantings were part of the building program of Octavian. The extensive construction work for the stadium and gymnasium would have greatly affected the pre-existing landscape, so it seems more likely that grove was contemporary with the construction of the stadium and the gymnasium.
On the hill, the tropaeum complex (Fig. 1) plays the role of both a victory monument and an open-air sanctuary dedicated to Mars, Neptune, and Apollo. It is built on two south-facing terraces. The first is defined by a massive retaining wall of opus caementum, dressed with opus quasi-reticulatum. Above it is the façade of the platform, a second retaining wall, its ends returning at right-angles into the hillside. The façade preserves cuttings to hold the bronze rams (rostra) of the defeated fleet of Cleopatra, while on its upper part were a number of large rectangular limestone blocks bearing a long dedicatory inscription in Latin to Mars and Neptune. On top of this wall was a second, much broader terrace, along three sides of which stood a pi-shaped portico, open to the south. The north wing of this portico marks the northern limit of the terrace, while its side wings run south up to the rear of the second retaining wall. The wings, which supported covered colonnades, created an inner courtyard 38x38 m. The area inside the courtyard framed by the porticos contained a monumental altar, probably dedicated to Apollo, and three pedestals, probably for over-life sized statues, as well as plantings. Dio (51.1.3) mentions that the monument also constituted an abode or throne (ἕδος) of the god Apollo, an abode or throne of the god Apollo. The altar was decorated with elaborate marble reliefs that referred directly or metaphorically to the battle and the events that followed. The main scene of the friezes decorating the altar depicts the triumph of Octavian at Actium.
During the excavation of the upper terrace within the peristyle courtyard sherds of at least eighteen complete or fragmentary ceramic planting pots of ovoid or piriform shape were found (Fig. 2). They indicate the presence of a grove that is not mentioned in any ancient sources. The average height of the pots is 14 cm and all of them have a wide hole (2.5 to 5 cm) in the bottom made before firing through which branches of a bush or shrub could be drawn through for air layering. The clay of the pots is fine and powdery, ranging in color from pale brown to pale yellow, and the surfaces of the pots were covered in a yellowish brown to gray slip. The survival of the pots is a result of their placement inside the natural soil of the hill.
The pots were placed along the outer stylobates of the porticos at a distance of between 20 to 60 cm from the stylobate. Two planting pots at the rear of the podium probably mark the extent of the courtyard to the south. Perhaps other plants were placed near the pedestals and the altar of the monument, but for the moment this cannot be proven. The exact distance between the pots is impossible to calculate, but from a few in situ examples, it appears that the plants were placed very close to each other in front of the columns. This arrangement would exclude the planting of large trees, which would cause damage to the porticos and cut off the view from the interior. No traces of the roots or the seeds of the plants that might have been in the pots have been found, but the plants used to decorate the sacred area of the monument may have been laurels for their association with Apollo and with victory, victorious generals, and their triumphs. In Octavian’s Actian triumph, depicted in the tropaeum of Nicopolis on the altar’s marble frieze, he stands on the currus triumphalis holding a laurel branch in his extended right hand and wearing a laurel wreath on his head. All the magistrates who accompany him in the triumph also wear laurel wreaths. The Roman Senate voted in 27 BCE that a laurel tree should be placed on each side of the door of the House of Augustus on the Palatine, and a civic crown of oak leaves should be placed above the door (Res Gestae 34). As an emblem of Octavian/Augustus, as well as Apollo, the laurel would have been a natural choice for his Sacred Hill where Octavian erected the monument as an act of pietas to his patron god and his divine supporters, Mars and Neptune.

Province Description Roman intervention in Greek political affairs resulted in conflicts that led to the destruction of Corinth in 146 B.C. and the sacking of Athens in 86 B.C. It was not until 27 B.C., however, that Augustus formally organized the Roman province of Achaea. Achaea consisted of the cities and territories of the southern Greek mainland between the Peloponnese and Thessaly, as well as Epirus in the northwest and the Ionian and some of the Aegean islands. The provincial capital was Corinth. Under Nero in the mid-1st century A.D. Epirus became a separate province, and in the mid-2nd century Thessaly was detached and added to the province of Macedonia. Under Roman domination many cities such as Athens, Sparta, Patras, and Corinth grew in size and prominence, the latter two partly owing to their importance as ports. After an initial decline in the number of rural sites in the early Empire, by the late Roman period the countryside was densely settled with farms and villas, due to changing landholding patterns and Roman improvements in agricultural and irrigation technology. The main exports from Achaea were wine, particularly from the northern Peloponnese, as well as olive oil and honey, linen and woolen textiles and marbles.

This, he says, was the grove that Homer praised in his poetry (Il. 2.506; see also Homeric Hymn to Apollo 229-238). Perhaps the trees that Pausanias saw were not quite as old as he thought, since Strabo, writing over a hundred years earlier, described the site as treeless and the temple empty (9.2.33). Replanting in the sanctuary might account for the presence of the trees seen later by Pausanias.

Garden Villa of Herodes Atticus
Keywords Archaeological exedrae (site elements) mosaics (visual works) nymphaea (garden structures) porticoes statues Garden Description A large (20,000 sq. m.) villa on a small hill near the ancient site of Eua has been systematically excavated since the 1980s. Most of the discoveries, however, remain unpublished. Because the earliest remains date to the Flavian period and an inscription mentions the name Hipparchus, father of Herodes Atticus (103-171 A.D.), it is likely that this was family property inherited by Herodes and transformed by him into one of the most luxurious Roman estates in Greece. At the center of the plan was a large garden defined on three sides (north, south, and east) by porticoes paved in mosaics representing various mythological scenes in a continuous sequence (850 sq. m.). The numerous statues placed in the garden, representing divinities, historical characters, athletes, and philosophers, were part of a decorative program in which the sculptural and mosaic themes were linked. For example, in the north portico, in front of a mosaic depicting Menelaus holding the body of Patroclus, fragments of a statuary group representing the same subject were found (“Pasquino” type). In the south portico, a sculpture of Achilles and Penthesilea (copy of a second century B.C. original from Pergamon) was found in front of a mosaic with the same subject. Other mosaic subjects are the hunt of Aeneas and Dido, the Horai and Charites, the labors of Heracles, and cupids making wine. The eastern part of the villa had a nymphaeum and an exedra, containing six statues depicting girls, one of which dates to the fifth century B.C. The villa also had a Serapeum and an Antinoön. After the death of Herodes the villa probably became imperial property. A phase dating to the Tetrarchy is attested, and during the time of Constantine a mosaic, depicting the Circus Maximus, was added. The villa was destroyed by an earthquake in A.D. 400 A.D. and by the invasions of the Goths.

Keywords Archaeological basins (vessels) nymphaea (garden structures) peristyles (Roman courtyards) Garden Description Several houses with peristyle courtyards were built north of the Areopagus in the second half of the 4th century A.D. These have been interpreted as schools of the Neoplatonic philosophers in which the school directors lived and students were instructed.
One of these buildings, the so-called House C or Omega House, had two peristyle courtyards, of which the eastern and smallest was paved (Fig. 1). The house was assured of a constant supply of water, as it tapped into a spring higher up on the hill. The nymphaeum and semi-circular collecting basin on the southeast corner of the house were fed by this, the overflow being directed through a pipe to a well on the west side of the central, rectangular peristyle courtyard. The water taken from this well may have been used to water a garden, possibly one in the unpaved courtyard in which the well was situated (G on plan). A collection of marble statues, portrait busts, and reliefs from the 4th century B.C. to the 3rd century A.D. was discarded in this and other wells of the house in the first half of the 6th century, possibly at the same time Justinian ordered that pagan schools should be closed down.

Keywords Literary gymnasiums Garden Description In the 4th century B.C., the schools and gardens of the philosophers Plato, Aristotle, Theophrastos and Epicurus were built in the vicinity of the gymnasia in the suburbs of Athens. Like the gymnasia, these schools were held in especially high esteem by members of the wealthy, educated class of Roman society who eagerly absorbed Greek culture and often completed their education in Athens. It is difficult to say in exactly what condition these schools were at this time, but the memory of them in their prime was still vivid. The educational institutions of Athens were maintained until the emperor Justinian decreed that the schools be closed in 529 A.D.
Many dialogues and descriptions of private villas of Roman aristocrats reveal that parts of their estates were landscaped and designed to evoke Greek gymnasia and schools, where, in theory at least, hours could be spent discoursing and philosophizing. Parts of the villas, such as those of Cicero and the emperor Hadrian, were occasionally named ‘Academy’ and &amp;ldquo;Lykeion&amp;rdquo; after the gymnasia and schools of Athens.
Cicero set the scene in De finibus (5.1.3) for a group of men in the Academy near the gardens of Epicurus in 79 B.C., and he mentioned the garden of Plato in the same suburb (Fin. 5.1.2). Roman statues of Epicurus and the Epicurean philosopher Colotes found outside the Dipylon gate on the road to the Academy may reflect some rebuilding prompted by Hadrian. Heliodoros (Aethiopica 1.16.5), writing in the 3rd century A.D., mentioned a gathering of men near the garden of Epicurus.

The late 5th century Athenian playwright, Euripides, made reference to the grove of Artemis in his Iphigenia in Aulis (185-186, 1543-1549). The shrine of Artemis at Aulis was visited by Pausanias in the 2nd century A.D., and he noted white stone statues (presumably marble) of Artemis and palm trees growing in the sanctuary (9.19.6-8). According to him, the fruit was not all edible, as it was in Palestine, but he remarked that the fruit ripened better than the dates in Ionia.

Garden Temple of Hephaistos
Keywords Archaeological myrtle (Myrtus communis) pits (earthworks) planting pots (horticultural containers) pomegranate (Punica granatum) Garden Description On the western edge of the Athenian Agora on Kolonos hill was the Temple of Hephaistos, built in the second half of the 5th century B.C. Excavations in 1937 around the temple revealed numerous square planting pits cut into the living rock in the 3rd century B.C. and again in the 1st century B.C. (Fig. 1). Rock-cut planting pits were preserved in four rows on the south, with isolated examples of such pits on the north and west sides (G on plan). The excavator cogently argued for rows of plantings to the north, south and west of the temple. The lack of planting pits on the north and west sides can be explained by the fact that the rocky hill upon which the temple was built fell away sharply on the north and west, requiring leveling layers above the natural rock. Into these deposits trees or shrubs were planted, leaving no trace of planting pits in the rock below. On the steeper southern side, however, the rock slope had to be shaved off, necessitating the cutting of planting pits into the rock. Possibly more than 60 such pits were arranged in rows parallel to the temple in the 3rd century; two rows on the north and south sides, and one row on the west side. After the Roman destruction of many Athenian buildings by Sulla in 86 B.C., at least the south side was replanted and two more rows of pits dug, resulting in four rows of trees or shrubs on this side. In many of the pits was a terracotta planting pot in ashy soil at a depth of ca. 50 cm. These planting pots, possibly containing laurel and pomegranate shrubs, had drainage and root holes in the bottom. The lack of maintenance of the irrigation pipes leading to the garden caused the plantings to wither and die by the second half of the 1st century A.D. The garden has been replanted with myrtle bushes and pomegranate trees.

Garden Library of Hadrian
Keywords Literary Archaeological colonnades gymnasiums Pausanias peristyles (Roman courtyards) piscinae Garden Description The most monumental building dedicated to education and intellectual pursuits in Athens was the so-called Library of Hadrian (Fig. 1). It consisted of four columned halls with exedrae at regular intervals on the north and south sides, and a library room flanked by lecture halls on the east.
In the center of the building was a large open peristyle courtyard with a long pool (stippled on plan). The courtyard has been reconstructed as a garden (G on plan) in which students and scholars could stroll, and there were almost certainly statues in this area. One is reminded of Vitruvius’ recommendation to plant the open areas between the colonnades of buildings with greenery, which he believed improved the air and made walks in this environment healthy for body and mind (Vitr. 5.9.5.). The building bears a strong resemblance typologically, and very likely thematically, to the late Hellenistic/early Roman gymnasium outside the city in the Academy. Pausanias, our literary source for Hadrian’s building projects in Athens, referred to the library as a splendid building with 100 columns, adorned with statues and paintings (Paus. 1.18.9).

Keywords Archaeological Literary elms (Ulmus sp.) gymnasiums olive trees (Olea europaea) palaestrae peristyles (Roman courtyards) plane trees (Platanus orientalis) poplars (Populus sp.) statues water features (landscaping) Garden Description The three most famous gymnasia in Athens, situated outside the city in naturally well-watered and shady sanctuaries of pre-Classical date, were those in the suburbs. In the Academy there was a shrine of the hero Hekademos; the Lykeion had a sanctuary of Apollo; and a cult site of Herakles was located in Kynosarges. The gymnasia in these suburbs were especially revered in Roman times as prestigious educational centers. They included running tracks and other sports grounds for physical training, rooms for literary instruction and baths spread out over a large area and loosely added to in the course of time. In each of the three areas foundation walls of a building enclosing a palaestra, or sports ground, of the 4th century B.C. have been excavated. Roman building activity in the Athenian suburbs is confirmed by Pausanius (1.18.9). According to him, Hadrian had a gymnasium named after him outside the walls of Athens near the Ilissos River in Kynosarges, although it is unclear whether he actually had a new gymnasium built here in the 2nd century A.D. or if he merely refurbished the old one. Roman honorific inscriptions and baths erected on the sites of the three suburban gymnasia indicate that they were kept up and modernized well after the Classical period.
Ancient literary references to the plane, elm, poplar, and olive trees in the Academy are numerous. Excavations in the suburb of Academy have shown that a new gymnasium was built there in the late Hellenistic/early Roman period. This gymnasium consisted of a central courtyard enclosed by porticoes on all four sides (Fig. 1). The northern wing of the building complex contained rooms which were probably used as libraries and for lectures, while the south, west and east wings appear to have had a row of desks, of which only the stone bases remain, running down the middle of each corridors. The courtyard itself may have been used as a palaestra for training, although by this period Greek education focused less on physical training than on lectures, debates, and literary study. The courtyard had a pool in the center (P on plan) and a podium for statues (S on plan), possibly of the Muses, at the northern end, both of which certainly would have restricted any space for athletics. No paving in the courtyard could be found, and it possible that it was planted in some way, perhaps with shade trees (G on plan).

One house on the northwest slope of the Areopagus, however, was of early Roman date and might have had a garden, since the surface of its peristyle courtyard was unpaved (Fig. 1). In the center of this courtyard was a rectangular water basin with apsidal ends, and in the southwest corner was a well. Another only partially excavated house of the mid-4th century A.D., built into the northern slope of the Areopagus, had a small courtyard (3.20 x 3.90 m.) paved with blue and white marble slabs surrounded by a masonry flower bed 50 cm. wide (Fig. 2; f on plan). Around this ran a shallow marble-paved basin (c on plan) which was supplied with water by a fountain on the south eastern side of the courtyard. Water flowed from the basin through a lead pipe in the middle of each side of the courtyard into the planter beds.

Garden Palace of the Giants
Keywords Archaeological gymnasiums peristyles (Roman courtyards) Garden Description A large complex of the early 5th century A.D. in the southern part of the Agora on the site of the earlier Odeon of Agrippa generally has been interpreted as a late Roman gymnasion (“Gymnasion of the Giants”) (Fig. 1). Homer Thompson, however, proposed that the building might have been an official residence maintained by the Imperial court with suitable temporary accommodations for high-ranking government officials. He suggested that the great northern courtyard may have met ceremonial needs as a reception area, while the other parts of the building served as quarters for guests, including bedrooms and baths. The northern courtyard (29 x 38 m.) was adorned with a row of statues stretching the length of the court. These included a figure of Epicurus, the great Classical philosopher who had a school and garden in the suburb of Academy in the 4th century B.C. Plantings in this setting would not be out of place thematically, but without any evidence for them, this must remain speculation.
It is possible that a garden might have been present in one of the inner courtyards of the building, especially since the complex was directly supplied by sufficient water from a late Roman aqueduct. The smallest of the courtyards (7 x 7 m.), the southeast court, was paved with terracotta tiles and cannot, therefore, have been planted, but the central courtyard seems not to have been paved (G on plan). The building stood on a plot of land of irregular shape that was enclosed within a boundary wall. This has been reconstructed as an informal garden area (G on plan), although no traces of plantings have survived. The complex was abandoned by ca. 530 A.D.

Pausanias (2.29.6) wrote that the shrine of Aiakos was surrounded by a grove of olive trees. Pausanias says that it had been there since ancient times, and a reference in 464 B.C. to the grove in Pindar’s Olympian Odes (13.109) confirms that it was much older. This sanctuary was located in a prominent spot in the harbor town and was enclosed within a wall built of white stone. At the time of Pausanias’ travels in Greece in the 2nd century A.D., the temple grove was still to be seen.

From the north and south corners of the house, walls ran in a westerly direction to enclose an open courtyard (G in Fig. 1) approximately 65 meters wide and 45 meters deep from the outer boundary to the main entrance of the house. A paved path was axially arranged in the courtyard to connect the entrance to the courtyard with that of the residential building. The western third of the courtyard is marked off by low scarps which may be remains of garden terraces (T in Fig. 1). Finds from the site indicate a 3rd/4th century date for the complex.

Iudaea (province) (Pleiades)
Province Description Judaea, the Roman province, included parts of the areas of the Hasmonean and Herodium kingdoms, notably Biblical Judah, Samaria, and Edom. Its capital was Caesarea Maritima. Roman influence in the region began in 63 CE, when the Roman general Pompey the Great took over Syria from Mithridates and, coming into Jerusalem, occupied the Second Temple. Pompey appointed Antipater, the father of Herod, as the first Roman Procurator. Later these ties allowed Herod to seek backing from Rome against the Hasmoneans in 40 BCE, when the senate recognized him as “king of the Jews.” His territories came to include the regions of Galilee, Gaulanitis (the Golan),Peraea and the Decapolis. Herod balanced his allegiance to Rome with the independence of his kingdom, often employing architectural projects to express his ambitions and control of nature to express his capacity to rule . His many palaces, placed strategically around the kingdom, feature dramatically designed landscapes and gardens. Upon his death, his heirs were unable to maintain order and Judea was annexed to Syria in 6 CE, although it was assigned its own procurator. By the time of Trajan, Judea was reduced in size and the Herodian palaces abandoned, preserving them over the millennia for archaeologists. Hadrian renamed the province Syria Palaestina after the Bar Kochba revolts (132-135) provoked him to erase the name of Judea.
The period for which we have the richest evidence of a garden culture in this region is during the reign of Herod the Great. A client king of Rome, Herod’s relationships with Mark Antony, Cleopatra, Augustus and Marcus Agrippa and other officials have been preserved in the texts of Flavius Josephus. These constitute a rare record of interactions between Rome and its territories, and provide a valuable context for understanding the trends of design in the early imperial period. The proximity of Judea to Alexandria, whose palaces and gardens lie beneath the modern city and its harbors, may also provide a suggestion of the late Hellenistic garden culture that Romans emulated. Evidence of gardens in the Hasmonean winter palaces at Jericho and the palaces of Hyracanus the Tobiad on the other side of the Jordan Valley provide rare cases where texts can illuminate archaeological evidence. These gardens require further investigation and both are threatened by local development. This geography of Judaea comprises a wide variety of biomes, from richly watered plains of the Galilee and the Jordan, to the semi arid Judean Hills, the humid, fertile coastal plain of the Mediterranean, and the deserts of the Dead Sea valley and the Negev.
Location Jericho
Jericho (Pleiades)
Location Description In one of the most beautiful spots of the Eastern Mediterranean, five km west of Jericho, the biblical “city of Palms,” (Deut. 34:3) lie the remains of a royal complex of the late Second Temple Period (the end of the second century B.C. continuing through the mid-first century A.D). Despite their location in the desert some 200 m. below sea level (one of the lowest occupied elevations on earth) these palaces were set amidst an abundance of vegetation and enjoyed a copious supply of water brought from the surrounding hills via water channels. The palaces are dramatically situated along Wadi Qelt where the gorge opens abruptly onto the Jordan Valley floor. (Fig. 1) They were set amidst the large palm and balsam groves for which the valley was famed. Water channels give archaeological evidence of groves to the north of the palace, but literary evidence suggests that royal holdings from Jericho to Ein Gedi were extensive. None of the gardens have been fully excavated, but many have been examined and the presence of rich soil rather than pavement, as well as water channels and ceramic planting pots provide conclusive evidence for the many gardens discussed below.

Keywords pleasure garden walled garden Garden Description Herodian Second Palace
The earthquake of 31 B.C. destroyed the Hasmonean palace complex, and the political changes that took place after Actium enabled Herod to gain full possession of the winter palaces. On top of the ruined palaces, he built a new complex (Fig 8). The two pools of the Pool Complex were unified to form a single, large pool (32 x 18m)! Gardens replaced the pavements around the pool, as evidenced by rows of ceramic planting pots found there. (Fig. 9) On the western side of the pool (A (B) 2), two rows of planting pots ran parallel to the pool. the distance between each pot was about two and a half meters apart while on the eastern side of the pool (A (B) 3) the pots were spaced about one meter apart. Colonnades were built around the larger of these pools and a hall was built on the western side (F), probably meant for the swimmers. A long, narrow Roman-style bath house was built to the west of this pool.
The main unit of the second palace included two wings. The northern wing, was elevated 5 meters above the southern wing and was built around a fairly large peristyle courtyard (34 x 28), flanked by rooms on three sides. The courtyard itself had an unusual structure. Its plan features a regular peristyle but the level of the open courtyard is c. 1 m. higher than that of the floors of the surrounding colonnades (Fig 10). Anyone walking around the courtyard would have seen, and perhaps even smelled, the flowering shrubs directly in front of them. Adjusted to the raised Peristyle garden was a triclinium, ornamented with wall panels and incorporated a window with a view onto the garden. Southern to the triclinium was a colonnaded balcony that overlooked the lower wing of the palace and a dramatic view of Wadi Qelt. The low wing of the palace (Fig 8, AK) incorporated the two Hasmonean swimming pools (one 20 x 20 m. and 7 x 7 m). Colonnades were built around the larger of the pools and a hall was built on the western side, probably meant for the swimmers. A long, narrow Roman-style bath house was built to the west of this pool.

Ein Gedi (Pleiades)
Location Description The balsam groves of the Dead Sea region have been famous since the queen of Sheba (Egypt and Ethiopia) reputedly brought balsam as a gift to King Solomon (1 Kings 10:10; Josephus Ant.8. 6, 5-6.). From the time of Theophrastus, Jericho and Ein Gedi near the Dead Sea were renowned for their watered palm and balsam plantations (paradeisoi), described by Diodorus Siculus, Varro, Strabo, Virgil, Horace, Pausanias, Pliny the Elder, Solinus and Galen. They are described in some detail by Josephus (Antiquitates Judaeorum 14.54), who notes their water supply was destroyed during the Jewish Revolt. The balsam, however, is regarded as extinct and has not been identified archaeobotanically.
Itzar Hirshfeld identified a possible balsam terrace near the oasis of Ein Gedi, along the ancient road that links the palaces at Jericho with the fortress palace at Masada. Further studies were carried out by Guy Stibbel.
The only possible archaeobotanical evidence found to date for the plant itself comes from a cave at Qumran. Porath and Arubas report that a small Herodian-period juglet wrapped in palm fibers and carefully hidden in the rocks contains oil that does not correspond with any known modern oil and is consistent with ancient descriptions of balsam but analysis on the contents was less than conclusive. Date palm remains, by contrast, are commonly seen in the carbonized plant remains found in Jericho, Wadi Qelt, Masada,Kumran, and other excavations in the valley. In an astonishing recent development, botanist Elaine Solowey was able to use growth hormones to activate three dessicated date pits from excavated contexts at Masada. These were C14 dated to the Roman period. One seed successfully grew into a male palm. Subsequent work with desiccated pits from the Kumran area have produced female plants. (Sallon et al. 2020)

Herod may have been a regular guest at the Hasmonean palace during his boyhood. Even after he effected his rule in 37 B.C., the Hasmoneans retained possession of their winter palace for a few years, according to Josephus. Artistobulus III was drowned there by Herod’s men when the royal court stayed at the palace as guests of Princess Alexandra, the mother of Aristobulus III and Herod’s wife, Mariamne.
His first palace, excavated in 1951 by J. Pritchard, was located to the south of Wadi Qelt, again, set amidst greenery. (Fig. 7a) The building was rectangular in shape and was built around three sides of a large peristyle garden. The planning of the palace shows a clear relationship to the courtyard; both the large rectangular triclinium and another reception room on the opposite side of the court’s axis, opened onto the peristyle offering the guests a good view of its gardens.
This first palace was “introverted” thus giving expression to Herod’s inferior status in Jericho at that time. The existence of any swimming pools near the building remains an open question, but a huge pool (180 x 150m) was found to the south near the modern settlement of Birket Musa. This pool may have been used for boating and water sports, as well as irrigation.

Sublocation Herodian Entertainment Complex, Third Palace
Sublocation Description The third palace built by Herod in the late first century B.C. merits special mention with regard to the integration of water, gardens and landscape. This palace was sited along a straight section of Wadi Qelt to take advantage of its season flow of water each winter. This area was, however, lower than those on which the first and second palaces had been built, offering a more limited view of the surroundings. This shortcoming was offset by the erection of a viewing pavilion on top of an artificial tel. The overall building complex was rectilinear, with Wadi Qelt cutting through the center, and a bridge spanning the two halves. On the north side lay a complex of banqueting rooms, Roman style baths, reception rooms, peristyle courtyards and colonnaded walks. On the south lay a great sunken garden, the artificial tel and pavilion, and, off-axis, a shallow boating pool. (Fig. 11) The garden features are discussed individually below.
Garden Royal Garden
Keywords pleasure garden walled garden Garden Description Corinthian Peristyle
With porticoes on three sides and measuring 23 x 14.5m, this courtyard, known as area B55, is decorated with columns in the Corinthian order. (Fig. 16) The lower portions of these smooth stucco shafts alternate between red and black; above them the columns are of fluted white stucco while the Corinthian capitals are of stone. Thus far, no entablature or roof tiles have been discovered. A low stone wall, known as a pluteus, ran between the columns. Water entered the garden at the north end, under the pluteus from the aqueduct channel serving the adjacent baths. As with garden B64, an opus signinum walk runs along the exterior perimeter of the porticoes. The ridged surface of the garden lies 12cm below the surrounding walk, which is neatly finished with a curb. The ridges are of packed earth, 3 or 4cm in depth, with no trace of plaster or mortar; and whereas in garden B64 there is a covering layer of fertilized soil, in B55 the ridges are exposed. Beneath the packed surface, lies coarse gravel, perhaps equivalent to the subsoil or fill in B64. No perforated pots were found. The only evidence of ornamentation within the garden is a large boulder, centrally placed and apparently part of the garden scheme rather than fallen debris. Along the curb, layers of mineral deposit were excavated from very fine silt sand. In some respects, this courtyard has the appearance of a pool, although its surfaces are not sealed with the grey hydraulic plaster usually employed in water features elsewhere in the palace complex. The nature of this courtyard remains uncertain pending further excavation, but the mouth of a water channel on the north end and the accreted mineral deposit such either a water feature or displays of plants receiving heavy irrigation.

Iudaea (province) (Pleiades)
Province Description Judaea, the Roman province, included parts of the areas of the Hasmonean and Herodium kingdoms, notably Biblical Judah, Samaria, and Edom. Its capital was Caesarea Maritima. Roman influence in the region began in 63 CE, when the Roman general Pompey the Great took over Syria from Mithridates and, coming into Jerusalem, occupied the Second Temple. Pompey appointed Antipater, the father of Herod, as the first Roman Procurator. Later these ties allowed Herod to seek backing from Rome against the Hasmoneans in 40 BCE, when the senate recognized him as “king of the Jews.” His territories came to include the regions of Galilee, Gaulanitis (the Golan),Peraea and the Decapolis. Herod balanced his allegiance to Rome with the independence of his kingdom, often employing architectural projects to express his ambitions and control of nature to express his capacity to rule . His many palaces, placed strategically around the kingdom, feature dramatically designed landscapes and gardens. Upon his death, his heirs were unable to maintain order and Judea was annexed to Syria in 6 CE, although it was assigned its own procurator. By the time of Trajan, Judea was reduced in size and the Herodian palaces abandoned, preserving them over the millennia for archaeologists. Hadrian renamed the province Syria Palaestina after the Bar Kochba revolts (132-135) provoked him to erase the name of Judea.
The period for which we have the richest evidence of a garden culture in this region is during the reign of Herod the Great. A client king of Rome, Herod’s relationships with Mark Antony, Cleopatra, Augustus and Marcus Agrippa and other officials have been preserved in the texts of Flavius Josephus. These constitute a rare record of interactions between Rome and its territories, and provide a valuable context for understanding the trends of design in the early imperial period. The proximity of Judea to Alexandria, whose palaces and gardens lie beneath the modern city and its harbors, may also provide a suggestion of the late Hellenistic garden culture that Romans emulated. Evidence of gardens in the Hasmonean winter palaces at Jericho and the palaces of Hyracanus the Tobiad on the other side of the Jordan Valley provide rare cases where texts can illuminate archaeological evidence. These gardens require further investigation and both are threatened by local development. This geography of Judaea comprises a wide variety of biomes, from richly watered plains of the Galilee and the Jordan, to the semi arid Judean Hills, the humid, fertile coastal plain of the Mediterranean, and the deserts of the Dead Sea valley and the Negev.
Location Jericho
Jericho (Pleiades)
Location Description In one of the most beautiful spots of the Eastern Mediterranean, five km west of Jericho, the biblical “city of Palms,” (Deut. 34:3) lie the remains of a royal complex of the late Second Temple Period (the end of the second century B.C. continuing through the mid-first century A.D). Despite their location in the desert some 200 m. below sea level (one of the lowest occupied elevations on earth) these palaces were set amidst an abundance of vegetation and enjoyed a copious supply of water brought from the surrounding hills via water channels. The palaces are dramatically situated along Wadi Qelt where the gorge opens abruptly onto the Jordan Valley floor. (Fig. 1) They were set amidst the large palm and balsam groves for which the valley was famed. Water channels give archaeological evidence of groves to the north of the palace, but literary evidence suggests that royal holdings from Jericho to Ein Gedi were extensive. None of the gardens have been fully excavated, but many have been examined and the presence of rich soil rather than pavement, as well as water channels and ceramic planting pots provide conclusive evidence for the many gardens discussed below.
Sublocation Herodian Entertainment Complex, Third Palace
Sublocation Description The third palace built by Herod in the late first century B.C. merits special mention with regard to the integration of water, gardens and landscape. This palace was sited along a straight section of Wadi Qelt to take advantage of its season flow of water each winter. This area was, however, lower than those on which the first and second palaces had been built, offering a more limited view of the surroundings. This shortcoming was offset by the erection of a viewing pavilion on top of an artificial tel. The overall building complex was rectilinear, with Wadi Qelt cutting through the center, and a bridge spanning the two halves. On the north side lay a complex of banqueting rooms, Roman style baths, reception rooms, peristyle courtyards and colonnaded walks. On the south lay a great sunken garden, the artificial tel and pavilion, and, off-axis, a shallow boating pool. (Fig. 6) The garden features are discussed individually below.
Garden Royal Garden
Keywords pleasure garden walled garden Garden Description Ionic Peristyle
This peristyle courtyard (19.1 x 18.7) lies adjacent to the banquet hall and near Roman baths constructed in opus reticulatum. It is referred to in excavation reports as area B64. The central garden is surrounded on three sides by a colonnade of cemented stone, stuccoed in white and red. Remains of plaster Ionic capitals and other stucco decoration were found during excavation, as well as frescoes with floral motifs of unusually high quality, perhaps made by Roman craftsmen. Rozenberg claimed that this courtyard was the most richly painted space in the palace An unusual feature of the peristyles in this complex is an opus signinum walk around the inner circumference of the peristyle, outside the columns flanking the garden.
The garden was first discovered in 1976 by E. Netzer, who excavated a trench through the center of the peristyle. The garden soil was poorly preserved, but ceramic planting pots appeared at the bottom of the garden. In 1985 and 1987, K. Gleason continued the excavations and found preserved garden soil layers beneath the destruction debris at the sides of the garden. (Fig. 13) The stratigraphy is reconstructed as follows:
The subsoil, probably fill, is composed of coarse, poorly cemented alluvial pebbles and cobbles. Above this, a thin layer of soil, in most places, plastered over, formed a rough surface over the courtyard, except at the north end, where the plaster tapers off onto a packed earth surface. The crude quality of the plaster and varying types of mortar suggest a working surface for the construction of the peristyle. When the garden was installed, trenches extending down into the subsoil levels were cut out of the plaster surface for the pots and planting pits. (Fig. 14) The flower pots at Jericho are unusual among Roman era pots. They are well-formed of local clay with a hole in the bottom and three holes in the side of the vessel, neatly punched before firing. Their similarity to local water-wheel pots is striking, except that in the planting pot the knob-like foot is open, like a bottle top, while closed in the water wheel pots. The Mishnah suggests that perforated pots, with holes in the bottom and sides, allowed the plants inside to make contact with the ground and thus allow plants or seeds in the pot to be considered like plants in the ground in most matters of agricultural law (Mishnah 8 in Kil’ayim), purity (eg Uktzin 1.9-10), and tithing (Gitin 21b-22a). The rabbis, at least during the redaction of the Mishnah, found that flower pots posed fascinating problems for interpretation.
The plantings were aligned in rows, roughly 1.5m apart. Between the rows, ridges were formed of small cobbles crudely plastered over, apparently to direct the flow of irrigation water. At the north end the situation appears to be somewhat different. The ridges characteristic of the plastered surface end approximately 2m from the walk in front of the apse. In this area only one pot was found, but late in excavation, after light rainfall, three planting pits became evident. These were filled with a light sandy loam, and two were free of flower-pot sherds. The fertilized garden soil was then laid over the whole area, 8-10cm deep and surrounding the pots, but only on the surface of the planting pits.
The plan reveals seven rows of up to eleven pots per row, although directly in front of the apse, tree pits were observed in place of the pots. This regular ordering of rows seems peculiar in such a public location, as Roman gardens of this period could be quite ornate in their layout. A garden at Pompeii laid out in such straight rows would be a market garden. However, the older, Hellenistic and Persian preference is for straight rows, and it is possible that this is a display garden for miniaturized plants (Langgut and Gleason).

Garden Royal Garden
Keywords pleasure garden walled garden Garden Description Sunken Garden
The monumental ‘sunken garden’ (B6), which measures 37.27 x 113.67m, lies largely unexcavated on the south side of Wadi Qelt, in alignment with the buildings and gardens described above (Fig 17). First explored in 1950 by Kelso and Baramki and again by Netzer in 1979, its perimeter is known, although the northern side has eroded into the wadi. Kelso and Baramki found a retaining wall on the south side, set into the slope of the hill and presenting a “grand facade” of semicircular and squared niches separated by columns in antis (fig 18). Jewish Law would have prohibited the placement of statuary in these niches, but urns with plants may have provided a satisfactory alternative and Stibel suggests that it served as a luxurious nympheum. The facade is interrupted in the middle by a great hemicycle (Fig 19), which formed a small stepped theatre, with benches not for spectators but for plants in perforated ceramic pots of the same general size and description as those found in garden B64 and elsewhere in the winter palace complex (Fig 20). A water channel ran along the floor of the sunken garden across entire length of the facade and cavea. Double porticoes along the top of the retaining walls, preserved on the east and west sides, allowed visitors to promenade around the sunken garden and look into it; what they observed remains buried beneath a deep landslide. In 1978, Netzer cut a trial trench along the foot of the east retaining wall and discovered a perforated pot at this lower level. (Fig. 21 and 22) Gleason examined the stratigraphy of this sounding in 1985 and noted that the pot was set into a level of cultivated soil.
Elevated Pavilion
Above the east end of the sunken garden rises the artificial tel with its pavilion, another unusual feature of Herod’s palace. The pavilion was round, 16 m. in diameter, serving as a reception hall with four niches in each quarter. Below the hall, as seen in the northern palace at Masada, lay a Roman-style bathhouse for the pleasure of guests visiting the hall. The artificial mount was undoubtedly erected to offer splendid views of the landscape with its oasis estates of rare palms and balsam, and would, in turn, be a landmark visible from the road descending from Wadi Qelt and from across the plain.
Boating Pool
A huge pool (90 x 40 m.) built to the east of the sunken garden formed an integral part of the third palace. The pool probably served not only for swimming but also for boating and aquatic sports. In contrast to all the other wings of the third palace, which were built in alignment with a single grid system, this pool deviates by c. 30 to accommodate the slope of the hill, evidently to offer spectators a good view of the events. The difference in orientation was possibly obscured by trees and shrubs, was the case with the Pool Complex of the second palace.

Location Herodium
Herodium (Pleiades)
Location Description Herodium
Herod the Great’s primary residence and burial place appears to have been this large palace complex 15 km southwest of Jerusalem. Here his court was within easy reach of the city, and on clear days the palace and the Mt. of Olives are visible in both directions. Herodium was an entirely new administrative and residential complex, commemorating his military victory over Antigonus for control of Jerusalem in 40 BCE. Herodium was begun c. 23-20 BC and offered a Herod a range of facilities in which he could perhaps live and conduct business more freely here than in Jerusalem. (Jewish Antiquities, XV, 323-325) The palace has two primary residential areas: the fortified palace atop a natural, but raised hilltop; and an unfortified palace that spans a gentle valley below. (Fig. 1) (Josephus Jewish War I, 419-421; Jewish Antiquities, XV, 323-325).
Garden Royal Garden
Keywords pleasure garden walled garden Garden Description Herod’s Tomb Garden
In 2005, Netzer’s team found the long-sought tomb of Herod, positioned on a terrace constructed into the slope of the artificial hill. This terrace was constructed of chipped stone and construction debris, largely the light limestone of the area. To the front and sides of the tomb, a layer of rich brown loam, similar to that found in the other garden areas, clearly indicated a garden. (Fig. 4) A small pool with lead piping was found to the side of the terrace. Although the lead pipes had been robbed, the pool evidently watered the terraced gardens (fig 1B, 2, and 3)

Iudaea (province) (Pleiades)
Province Description Judaea, the Roman province, included parts of the areas of the Hasmonean and Herodium kingdoms, notably Biblical Judah, Samaria, and Edom. Its capital was Caesarea Maritima. Roman influence in the region began in 63 CE, when the Roman general Pompey the Great took over Syria from Mithridates and, coming into Jerusalem, occupied the Second Temple. Pompey appointed Antipater, the father of Herod, as the first Roman Procurator. Later these ties allowed Herod to seek backing from Rome against the Hasmoneans in 40 BCE, when the senate recognized him as “king of the Jews.” His territories came to include the regions of Galilee, Gaulanitis (the Golan),Peraea and the Decapolis. Herod balanced his allegiance to Rome with the independence of his kingdom, often employing architectural projects to express his ambitions and control of nature to express his capacity to rule . His many palaces, placed strategically around the kingdom, feature dramatically designed landscapes and gardens. Upon his death, his heirs were unable to maintain order and Judea was annexed to Syria in 6 CE, although it was assigned its own procurator. By the time of Trajan, Judea was reduced in size and the Herodian palaces abandoned, preserving them over the millennia for archaeologists. Hadrian renamed the province Syria Palaestina after the Bar Kochba revolts (132-135) provoked him to erase the name of Judea.
The period for which we have the richest evidence of a garden culture in this region is during the reign of Herod the Great. A client king of Rome, Herod’s relationships with Mark Antony, Cleopatra, Augustus and Marcus Agrippa and other officials have been preserved in the texts of Flavius Josephus. These constitute a rare record of interactions between Rome and its territories, and provide a valuable context for understanding the trends of design in the early imperial period. The proximity of Judea to Alexandria, whose palaces and gardens lie beneath the modern city and its harbors, may also provide a suggestion of the late Hellenistic garden culture that Romans emulated. Evidence of gardens in the Hasmonean winter palaces at Jericho and the palaces of Hyracanus the Tobiad on the other side of the Jordan Valley provide rare cases where texts can illuminate archaeological evidence. These gardens require further investigation and both are threatened by local development. This geography of Judaea comprises a wide variety of biomes, from richly watered plains of the Galilee and the Jordan, to the semi arid Judean Hills, the humid, fertile coastal plain of the Mediterranean, and the deserts of the Dead Sea valley and the Negev.
Location Herodium
Herodium (Pleiades)
Location Description Herodium
Herod the Great’s primary residence and burial place appears to have been this large palace complex 15 km southwest of Jerusalem. Here his court was within easy reach of the city, and on clear days the palace and the Mt. of Olives are visible in both directions. Herodium was an entirely new administrative and residential complex, commemorating his military victory over Antigonus for control of Jerusalem in 40 BCE. Herodium was begun c. 23-20 BC and offered a Herod a range of facilities in which he could perhaps live and conduct business more freely here than in Jerusalem. (Jewish Antiquities, XV, 323-325) The palace has two primary residential areas: the fortified palace atop a natural, but raised hilltop; and an unfortified palace that spans a gentle valley below. (Fig. 1) (Josephus Jewish War I, 419-421; Jewish Antiquities, XV, 323-325).
Garden Royal Garden
Keywords pleasure garden walled garden Garden Description Lower Herodium
Lower Herodium (Fig. 1C) comprises several units. Here the central focus is the large pool, the water of which was supplied by a 6 km long aqueduct built by Herod from the spring at the modern village of Artas. The pool is set into a huge garden terrace 120 X 110 m. in size. It was constructed by blocking and leveling a whole section of a valley with up to 8 m of fill. A stepped retaining wall, like a dam, supports the terrace to the east of the garden, as well as two long halls, one on the garden level and the other below, looking down the valley. The garden itself is surrounded on three sides (north, west and south) by wide colonnades situated about 1.5m higher than the garden. The pool was probably used for swimming, for small boats, as a water reservoir, and as a central architectural focus at “the heart” of Lower Herodium. A tholos-type pavilion topped the circular stone foundation (13.5 m in diameter) exposed in the center of the pool. The majority of the buildings at Lower Herodium, still largely unexcavated, are laid out in a “U” shaped cluster around this large garden.
A limited examination of the courtyard area by K. Gleason in December 1985 supports the theory that the courtyard was planted, although it may have had substantial areas with plastered walks and seating areas, as one might expect around a pool. Immediately below the plaster surface, above the terrace fill, a rich, mottled loam with potsherds, suitable for cultivation was identified, suggesting either an earlier garden planted over the entire area, or simply a soil layer that permitted trees and shrubs to be planted within an overall scheme of trees, shrubs, and paved places for bathers to relax. Small test trenches did not reveal any planting pits; however, the rich soil was seen in the stratigraphy of earlier trenches throughout the site suggesting shaded smooth plastered surfaces and probable areas of garden beds.

Location Caesarea Maritima
Caesarea Maritima (Pleiades)
Location Description Ultimately the capital of the Roman provinces of Judaea and Syria Palestina, the city was built by Herod the Great. He acquired the old Hellenistic city of Strato’s Tower from Octavian as part of a territorial expansion after Actium, and turned the modest natural harbor here into a major port city, laid out on an orthogonal urban plan. Reminiscent of the basilaea of Alexandria, the southern area of the city was devoted to Herod’s seaside palace, in its early phase, and to public entertainment facilities by the time of the city’s opening in 12 BC. Josephus describes the port and the features of the city (AJ 15.9.6.331 and BJ 1.21.5. 408) including an “amphitheatron” and theater in the south, where archaeologists have discovered and restored a stadium and a theater. These are in the area of the archaeological remains of a palace, also noted but not located by Josephus. The city was a successful enterprise, and by the second and third centuries CE the stadium functions had moved inland and expansive villas were constructed over the remains of the stadium. By the Byzantine era, these villas were incorporated into a new praetorium. These palaces and villas have gardens, discovered in varying degrees of preservation, supplied with water through water channels, initially from the aqueduct and later from wells. Upon the destruction of this district of the city, the Arab inhabitants developed gardens amidst the ruins, irrigated by wells and water channels.

Keywords pleasure garden walled garden Garden Description Byzantine Law Court and Roof Garden
Architectural analysis and epigraphic finds excavated by Josef Patrich and the Combined Caesarea Excavations suggest that the buildings in the area immediately south of the harbor (Area CC) formed a governmental compound of Roman - Byzantine Caesarea, comprising a Revenue Office (skrinion), a Law Court and adjacent to them an archive or library for judicial and financial records and books. Earlier archaeologists (JECM) had identified this complex as an honorific U-shaped building; however, it is clearly the inverse. Constructed about 200 CE, the Law Court was a vast hall (13 x 18 m.), built on top of four vaults facing west. In the first phase, the hall faced west to the sea and was surrounded on three sides (N, E and S) by a reflection pool. To its east a square fountain was constructed. (Fig.1)
During the second phase, the pool was converted to a roof garden, filled in with the rich, red sandy soil, locally known as hamra (also noted in the upper courtyard at the promontory palace.) The soil was set on a surface of bipedal ceramic tiles (ca. 60 x 50 cm), which in turn were supported on suspensurae of flat sandstone blocks (each 20 x 20 cm and 15 cm thick) supporting the corners of four bipedal tiles. This arrangement formed a separating space between the roof of the vaults and the garden soil, preventing moisture from damaging the ceiling of the vaults (Fig. 2). This arrangement has no known parallels in Israel, but was used over vaults for the gardens of Tiberius on the Palatine in Rome, a form of nemora pensile, or hanging gardens.
During this phase the building looked out over an extended garden on the east side. Here the garden soil (hamra) extended beyond the eastern wall of the former reflection pool to include the square fountain. The garden was irrigated by a water tank (ca. 3 x 3 m.) erected on ground level between the hall and the fountain, the dimensions of which were reduced at this phase. The eastern wall of the reflection pool was partially dismantled to accommodate this tank.
During the third phase, in the 6th century, the entire garden, including the fountain, was covered by a mosaic floor.

A seaside palace west of the theater at Caesarea Maritima has been identified by E. Netzer as the maritime palace Herod the Great built to supervise construction of the great harbor, and, later, to provide reception space for guests at spectacles and official functions. (Fig. 1) The view north from this promontory became increasingly impressive as the harbor was completed and thrived. The palace served as the official praetorium of his heirs and subsequent Roman officials. Lower Promontory Excavations in the 1970s by Netzer and Lee I. Levine in the lower area of the palace revealed a series of luxurious reception rooms and heated chambers centering on a large (35 x 18 m.) rock-cut swimming pool enclosed by a colonnade. Cuttings in the bedrock between the columns suggested to Netzer that planters had been built between the columns, offering a pluteus around the pool, as well as a planting area protected from the salt spray. (Fig. 2) Upper Palace Excavations by K. Gleason and B. Burrell for the University of Pennsylvania Museum (1990-1996), in collaboration with E. Netzer and Hebrew University; and by Y. Porath of the Israel Antiquities Authority (1993-1996), have revealed an upper, more public half of the palace connected to the stadium (also referred to as an amphitheater by Porath following Josephus) and the theater. The upper palace comprised a series of baths and reception rooms facing out onto a quadriportico (42 x 65 m.) Although the courtyard was paved in plastered crushed sandstone in later Roman phases, fragmentary areas of layers of rich red sand (hamra), popular today with gardeners, were used to level many areas of the courtyard and may indicate the presence of vegetation or a gardened area in the first Herodian period and possibly a gardened courtyard in the first phase of the upper palace’s peristyle courtyard, but soil pits and other planting features were not preserved in any detectable pattern. (Fig. 3) Pollen extracted from plaster on the kurkar columns of the surrounding colonnade included taxa likely to have been growing within the courtyard: Cypress (Cupressus&amp;ndash;either juniperus or sempervirens), hazelnut (Corylus, a non-native), and the herbaceous taxa, Brassicacaea, Salvia, and Cistus (Fig. 4). A fourth century AD well briefly supplied water for the courtyard. Curse tablets (defixiones) at the bottom of this well indicate the popular practice of wishing ill, rather than wishing well.
Foundations of garden architecture, water channels and garden soils of the late Byzantine period have also been found, best preserved in the eastern half of the site.

These gardens require further investigation and both are threatened by local development. This geography of Judaea comprises a wide variety of biomes, from richly watered plains of the Galilee and the Jordan, to the semi arid Judean Hills, the humid, fertile coastal plain of the Mediterranean, and the deserts of the Dead Sea valley and the Negev.
Location Masada
Masada (Pleiades)
Location Description Masada, originally a Hasmonean defensive post, was the refuge for Herod’s family during the journey to Rome that led to his kingship. They nearly perished of thirst, but the winter rains arrived to fill the cisterns at the last possible moment. (Josephus, Jewish Antiquities XIV. 358-60; 391) Once Herod consolidated his power, he turned this barren desert mountaintop into a luxurious oasis palace overlooking the Dead Sea (Josephus Jewish War VII, 289-291.) (Fig. 1) The site is more famous as the last stand of the Zealots during the Jewish Revolt of AD 66 and remains of Roman forts surround the palace on the lower slopes and valley floor.
Garden Royal Garden
Keywords pleasure garden walled garden agriculture Garden Description The earliest phases of Herodian building are seen in the Western Palace area. These buildings are architecturally similar to the Hasmonean palaces at Jericho and include the garden features of the southern area of the mountain top: water channels, cisterns, two swimming pools, and a columbarium. Gleason has studied the garden area briefly in 1990 and 1996 and found evidence of garden soil fertilized with domestic debris including potsherds. (Fig. 2) The sherd scatters are the main remaining evidence of this soil. It is possible that when the Zealots built the earthen fortification on the last night of the siege that the soils of the gardens may have been the quickest to remove. This or wind erosion appears to have removed any trace of the hilltop “being of rich soils…softer than any plain and given up to cultivation.” The potsherd types indicate that the garden area was cultivated by both Herod and the Zealots. There is no evidence of cultivation in the south area during the Byzantine period. Aerial photographs dating prior to the excavations may suggest that the gardens were laid out and managed in the manner of Nabataean desert agriculture in the region and future work at the site may shed further light on the layout of the garden.
The Northern or Hanging Palace, the latest of Herod’s constructions on the site, is a spectacular feature of architecture, engineering and landscape architecture. A series of platforms were created by alternately creating retaining walls and carving into the precipitous northern face of the mountain. On these platforms, he built a series of pavilions for dining, reception, baths and guest quarters. The contrast between the interior luxury of these rooms and the brilliant and utterly desolate landscape of the Dead Sea is sublime. Room xxx, in particular, sheltered guests amidst frescos of garden foliage (Fig. 3) and only steps away presented a spectacular overlook of the desert view. Herod’s reputation for “defying nature” (Josephus xx) is nowhere more refined than in this complex.

Herodium (Pleiades)
Location Description Herodium
Herod the Great’s primary residence and burial place appears to have been this large palace complex 15 km southwest of Jerusalem. Here his court was within easy reach of the city, and on clear days the palace and the Mt. of Olives are visible in both directions. Herodium was an entirely new administrative and residential complex, commemorating his military victory over Antigonus for control of Jerusalem in 40 BCE. Herodium was begun c. 23-20 BC and offered a Herod a range of facilities in which he could perhaps live and conduct business more freely here than in Jerusalem. (Jewish Antiquities, XV, 323-325) The palace has two primary residential areas: the fortified palace atop a natural, but raised hilltop; and an unfortified palace that spans a gentle valley below. (Fig. 1) (Josephus Jewish War I, 419-421; Jewish Antiquities, XV, 323-325).

Keywords pleasure garden walled garden Garden Description Palace Fortress
The Palace Fortress is a cylindrical structure originally seven stories high (two vaulted corridors in the substructure and five stories of corridors each having its floors supported on wooden beams). In the open interior of the cylinder, palace quarters were designed with luxuriously appointed rooms facing onto a 41x18m courtyard (Fig 1A). These included a triclinium/reception hall, baths, and living quarters. This peristyle featured colonnaded corridors on three of its sides, the two shorter of which were decorated by exedra. The interior focal point for these rooms was a garden, which has been excavated to approximately its original surface. The soil of the garden is clearly amended with fertilizer and suitable for cultivation using water from the cisterns beneath the palace.

Province Description Judaea, the Roman province, included parts of the areas of the Hasmonean and Herodium kingdoms, notably Biblical Judah, Samaria, and Edom. Its capital was Caesarea Maritima. Roman influence in the region began in 63 CE, when the Roman general Pompey the Great took over Syria from Mithridates and, coming into Jerusalem, occupied the Second Temple. Pompey appointed Antipater, the father of Herod, as the first Roman Procurator. Later these ties allowed Herod to seek backing from Rome against the Hasmoneans in 40 BCE, when the senate recognized him as “king of the Jews.” His territories came to include the regions of Galilee, Gaulanitis (the Golan),Peraea and the Decapolis. Herod balanced his allegiance to Rome with the independence of his kingdom, often employing architectural projects to express his ambitions and control of nature to express his capacity to rule . His many palaces, placed strategically around the kingdom, feature dramatically designed landscapes and gardens.

Despite their location in the desert some 200 m. below sea level (one of the lowest occupied elevations on earth) these palaces were set amidst an abundance of vegetation and enjoyed a copious supply of water brought from the surrounding hills via water channels. The palaces are dramatically situated along Wadi Qelt where the gorge opens abruptly onto the Jordan Valley floor.

Erected on the southern margin of the royal estate around 120 B.C., north of Wadi Qelt, the palace has not yet been studied in its entirety, since at a later stage most of it was buried (Fig 2 area AA). At its center lay a courtyard measuring (25 x 18m) flanked by rooms on three sides, probably bedrooms and reception rooms. Although the inner courtyard lacked any archaeological evidence for vegetation, sections of walls and clay pipes suggest that the building was surrounded by orchards and gardens, some of which might have been formal.
Over the years, two swimming pools (probably one for men and one for women), each measuring 10 x 9 m. and 3 m. deep, were added to the palace building (Fig 2 area AB). Each pool had a broad flight of stairs along one of its sidewalls leading down to the bottom, and both had benches built into the tops of the side walls. The pools were probably surrounded by paved plazas with installations for the use of the bathers.

The ascent to the throne of Alexander Jannaeus in 103 B.C. triggered a significant development in the above palace. He constructed another conduit from the “Auja and Na’aran” springs to the north of the palace site, which improved the gardens and bathing facilities. Immediately to the east of the palace, he built a new complex of two swimming pools, each measuring 18 x 13 m., surrounded by paved plazas, and a pavilion to the south of the pools. These elements were surrounded by formal gardens, some of which were peripheral, while others were independent units. The largest of all (70 x 60 m.) was surrounded by colonnades. This splendid layout was built along an axis of symmetry, with the pavilion at one end and a peristyle courtyard at the other end. This may be the first archaeological evidence in the Hellenistic-Roman world of an architectural complex whose main function was to provide bathing and swimming facilities.
By 90 BCE, Jannaeus was experiencing political and military difficulties, and it seems that vacations in Jericho had become dangerous. To address security problems, he buried the palace of his father and on top of it he built an elevated, fortified palace surrounded by a moat. The new building offered the advantages of better views across the renowned estate of palm and balsam groves and greater exposure to breezes.

Garden Villae Rusticae
Keywords villae rusticae Garden Description Probable garden soils have been identified in a partially excavated palatial complex from the Herodian period. (Fig. 1) The fortified residential complex is a huge square covering an area of over 5,000 square meters. Towers stood in the four corners of the precinct, which thus appears to have been what was called in the Hellenistic period a tetrapyrgion- type palace. Josephus also uses the term in describing the palace at Masada (Wars 7, 289). This is the best preserved example known to date in Palestine. The palace’s inhabitants were probably members of Jewish elite during and after Herod’s reign, as the complex was abandoned during the great Revolt.
The villa shows the range of indications of Hellenistic and Roman cultural influences of Herod’s time: a columbarium, areas of cultivated soils near the building, water channels, and a heated bathhouse of the Roman style. Amended cultivated soils have also been noted in other areas of the palace building complex, which will be investigated in future seasons.

The house at the west is of the winged corridor type, fronted by a large courtyard bisected by a paved central drive with a banked edge. Between the outer courtyard wall and the house were areas used for gardening (G in Fig. 1). Just inside the outer yard wall on the south side of the drive traces of at least six bedding trenches cut into the natural subsoil and running parallel to each other were followed for at least 5 meters (b in Fig. 1). These have been interpreted by the excavator as the remains of vegetable gardens (Fig. 2). He also attributed a number of stake holes in this area to small fences bounding the vegetable gardens, and suggested the possibility of an orchard on the northern side of the drive as well as a formal flower garden nearer to the house between the projecting wings, for which there is no concrete archaeological evidence. Finally a small pit just inside the courtyard gateway may represent a pit dug to take one of a pair of trees flanking the entrance.

The trend toward formal gardens and swimming pools at the palace complex gained new expression during the reign of Janneaus’ widow, 76 to 32 B.C.E.

Each half of the twin palaces, which were located to the south of the Pool complex, was built around a paved inner courtyard. (Fig. 5) The reception room and triclinium opened onto each of the courts via distyle in antis.
Alongside each of the twin palaces was a swimming pool surrounded by a garden and fence. Small reception halls appear to have been constructed next to the pools. In the eastern garden, we also exposed a garden-triclinium that was probably open to the sky, the floor of which was once covered by water; the benches were decorated with frescoes.
Apparently at the same time, changes were made in the Pool Complex, indicating a greater sensitivity to the garden areas. A wall separating the swimming pools from the peristyle garden to the north was demolished and replace by a row of columns. West of the pools, a large hall (11 x 6.5m) probably served for receptions.
After Alexandra’s death, during the period from 67-32, a large swimming pool (20 x 12.5) was added to the east of the twin palaces. At the same time, installations for bathing and ritual immersion were built over the small garden west of the Pool complex. Three long, narrow storerooms, probably for the storage of produce from the larger royal estate, were erected in the corresponding small garden to the east of the pools. (Fig. 6)

Keywords arbors archaeological garden axial plan loam villae rusticae Garden Description At this site in Hertfordshire near the town of Verulamium (St. Albans) excavations have revealed a multi-phased Roman farm, characterized in late Iron Age and Roman times by an outer courtyard with various service buildings and an inner courtyard in which the farm house stood (Fig. 1).
An avenue 20 meters wide led axially from the gate at the eastern end of the inner courtyard a cross to the front of the house (H in Fig. 1). On either side of the avenue was a line of circular pits spaced 4-6 meters apart (A in Fig. 1). These were filled with fine, homogeneous loam and have been interpreted as planting holes for trees or shrubs. Alternatively, the rows of holes have been interpreted as the postholes of a covered walkway or arbour leading to the house, supporting climbing plants. This feature of the courtyard is contemporary with the first masonry house built around A.D. 100, and represents an attempt to design the compound fronting the house in a more formal way. After 175 the avenue leading to the rebuilt house seems not to have been flanked by trees or an arbour, and numerous trackways leading into both courtyards from the north and south suggest that the entrance to the main residence was no longer strictly axial.

Although the site was not completely excavated, there is evidence to suggest that the main residence (A in Fig. 1) was located at the southern end of the complex, separated from various workshops and subsidiary buildings in the northern half by an area of cultivated soil. This area has been interpreted as a garden, based on the absence of buildings and the presence of 10-15 centimeters thick layer of rich humus (G in Fig. 1). The complex was built between A.D. 280 and 300, with occupation ending around 380.

Keywords archaeological garden ditches fences (site elements) kitchen gardens orchards paddock rural villas villae rusticae Garden Description This Roman villa in Gloucestershire is situated about 14 miles west of the civitas capital Corinium Dobunnorum (Cirencester). The main residence is of the winged corridor type, fronted by a large courtyard which was bounded by the house on one side, by a wall on the two sides perpendicular to the house and by a fence on the fourth side opposite the house (Fig. 1). The yard measured 56 x 53 meters.
Excavated evidence indicates that this courtyard was designed as a formal garden in the early 4th century. The courtyard was bisected by a central drive 5 meters wide consisting of rubble with a layer of heavy metalling on top and bounded by kerb stones (P in Fig. 1). It led from the courtyard gate at the southeast and continued to the front of the house. The garden consisted of two planting beds near the house, a hedge and two long beds on either side of the drive (dark grey in Fig. 1) (Fig. 2). These beds had been dug into the stone and gravel and then filled with 20 centimeters of very dark soil. It is not known what plants grew here, although carbonized remains of box plants at the villa may reflect one type of greenery planted in the courtyard. The northeast part of the yard was paved with stone and gravel (dotted in Fig. 1), the southwest part, however, was not paved, suggesting that this part of the garden might have been used as an orchard or an area for trees or shrubs (O in Fig. 1). The formal garden was destroyed by 5th century cultivation. Northwest of the house, i.e. at the back, various ditches marked off a number of areas interpreted as possible paddocks and an area covered with a layer of very dark soil which has been interpreted as a kitchen garden.

Garden Roman Palace in Fishbourne
Keywords archaeological garden basins (vessels) colonnades loam palaces piscinae presence chambers terrace gardens vegetable gardens Garden Description Fishbourne Roman Palace was accidentally discovered during the digging of a water main trench in 1960. The discovery led to nine seasons of excavations (1961-69) that showed the site had developed from a military base at the time of the Roman invasion in AD 43 to a sumptuous palace by the end of the first century CE. Carefully excavated by Barry Cunliffe, using techniques of environmental archaeology, the garden excavations at the palace have long served as a model in the development of Roman garden archaeology, although the findings did not initially prompt the investigation of other gardens in Britain. Today the site has been developed for display and education.
The palace contains gardens within its internal courtyards, as well in a larger area to the south, where terraces and other landscape architectural features lay between the residence and the deep water channel (Fig 1.). The main garden of the palace is located in the large central courtyard, and dates to the late 1st century CE. Only the northern half has been excavated, while the remainder lies beneath the gardens of adjacent houses. The garden is bisected by a wide path leading between the entrance to the villa and a large audience hall. Lining the path, bedding trenches in alternating rectangular and semi-circular patterns survived as patterns of dark gray loam against an ochre-colored clay and gravel subsoil. Similar cuttings were found along the colonnades.
Pollen samples were taken in the garden areas in the hope that traces of pollen had survived from flowers and shrubs that had grown in the garden. Unfortunately, only a small quantity of pollen from weeds of cultivation, such as plantain and daisy, remained. As no positive archaeobotanical evidence for specific plants survived on site, literary sources were used to select plants that would have survived in the conditions of this northern province. Pliny the Younger refers to clipped box lining the edges of the pathways in the gardens of his Tuscan estate. This lime-loving shrub would have been very appropriate in the deliberately marled loam of these trenches, so, in 1968, it was planted and has thrived. Figure 2 shows the excavated trenches, and figure 3 shows the replanted box.
On the eastern side of the formal garden, alternating tree-pits and post holes were found. The pattern suggested an original arrangement of trees or shrubs planted against a trellis. Again, Pliny the Younger mentions espaliered apples in his gardens, and these have been successfully established at Fishbourne. Less successful was the effort to establish Italian cypress in the location of a large tree-pit found towards the western side of the garden.
Beneath the surface of the garden, the excavators discovered lines of ceramic pipes. They ran from the remains of the base of what is assumed to have been a water storage tank in the northwest corner of the formal garden. One line of pipes probably fed a pool in the entrance hall while others supplied small semi-circular basins set in recesses in the box hedging. Half a marble basin was found in the 1960&amp;rsquo;s.
There is circumstantial evidence for there having been a vegetable garden in the angle between the ends of the north and west wings of the palace where there is a dark, humus-rich soil containing heavily abraded pottery, suggesting that the soil had been intensively cultivated. It also had its own water supply, provided through wooden pipes with iron collars.
Limited excavations to the south of the palace revealed an artificial terrace which bore evidence of landscaping, including a pool, a gravel path, possible bedding trenches and what may have been the base for a column or statue. Excavations to the east of the palace in the mid 1980&amp;rsquo;s uncovered evidence for semi-formal gardens.

The masonry pool measuring 25 x 3.50 meters lay parallel to the house frontage. From the pool ran a masonry drain. Although no traces of bedding trenches or plantings have been detected in the yard around the pool, it might be assumed that the pool was a centerpiece of a garden (G in Fig. 1). Interestingly, in the backfill of a ditch under the southeast wing of the villa at least thirty planting pots were retrieved in excavations. The vessels had three knife-cut triangular holes in the lower body and a round hole through the base (Fig. 2, nest page). The pots were misfired and almost certainly manufactured in kilns near the villa in the decade after A.D. 50. Although the planting pots were not found in context in pits within a garden, it is clear that they were being produced locally for use at Eccles or other gardens nearby. Excavations have established that the estate was continually occupied from the middle of the 1st century until the 4th century. In its final 4th century form, the villa complex measured 89 x 116 meters, including its wings and the courtyard.

Keywords archaeological garden kitchen gardens piscinae rural villas villae rusticae waterspouts Garden Description Excavations at this site of a Roman villa in Kent uncovered a large rectangular masonry pool in the courtyard, which was enclosed by buildings on the north, west, and east (Fig. 1). The villa buildings took up an area of 150 x 225 meters in total, including the courtyard with a width of 26.5 meters. Occupation at the site began after A.D. 100 and continued until the closing decades of the 4th century.
This pool (P in Fig. 1), measuring 25.6 x 3.36 meters, lay at right angles to the center of the main residence and bisected an enclosed courtyard, possibly a garden (G in Fig. 1) in front of the house. The pool would have been a decorative element in the courtyard. Within the pool at the end nearest the house was found a small bronze water-spout in the form of the head of a lioness. At the other end was a semi-circular pool with provision for the inflow and outflow of water.
South of the western range of rooms was a large, open space measuring 14.6 x 58.4 meters, enclosed by walls. There was no paving in this area, nor was there any evidence for partitions. It has been suggested that this might have been a kitchen garden (G in Fig. 1).

Keywords archaeological garden animal bone bathhouses (water recreation structures) drains mosaics (visual works) sherds villae rusticae Garden Description This Roman villa in Gloucestershire was partially excavated in the late 19th century, but only the built features and their mosaic floors appear to have been of interest to the Victorian diggers. Excavations in the courtyard conducted between 2000 and 2002 revealed that earlier excavators had not disturbed the courtyard.
Parts of the villa may date to the early 3rd century A.D. at the latest, but extensions to existing buildings and the arrangement of the residential wings around an open courtyard can be ascribed to the early 4th century (Fig. 1). The slightly trapezoidal courtyard had a maximum width of 25 meters and a maximum length of 40 meters. The recent excavations in the courtyard show that in the early 4th century soil was brought in and dumped over earlier built features such as drains, transforming the newly created courtyard into a garden (G in Fig. 1). In places, this garden soil was as much as 50 centimeters deep. The dark garden soil containing domestic refuse does not appear to have been reworked regularly for cultivation since the sherds and animal bones in it were not abraded. The courtyard surface may have been lawned rather than planted with flowers, hedges or other vegetation. Excavations have not revealed planting pits or planting beds, but the possibility of randomly spaced trees cannot be ruled out. The courtyard must have been a high-status element of this residential part of the estate, the rooms arranged around the garden having included private dining rooms and baths. In the second half of the 4th century the garden was abandoned and parts of the courtyard roughly paved with flagstones, indicating that the area in its later years possibly functioned as a yard for animals and wheeled traffic or for other utilitarian purposes.

Province Description After Caesar’s campaigns in Britain in 55 and 54 BC, the southern part of the island lay within Rome’s sphere of influence. It was not until the Claudian invasion in 43 AD, however, that Britain was annexed as a Roman province, although the ‘conquest’ of Britain in the west and north continued and proceeded slowly in the decades thereafter. Apart from a brief interlude in the mid-2nd century, when the northern border of the province was fixed at the Antonine Wall in Scotland, from the 120&amp;rsquo;s the northern frontier of the island lay on Hadrian’s Wall stretching from the west to the east coast. The provincial capital was Londinium (London) on the Thames River.
Britain is geographically and geologically diverse, and it was characterized in the Roman period by a variety of confined ecosystems. Even before the conquest, grain, cattle, and metals, were exported to the continent. Cereal production, chiefly spelt wheat and barley, were the mainstay of the Roman agrarian economy of the province. In the 3rd and 4th centuries, Britain was a prosperous and secure place, little threatened by the barbarian incursions disrupting life across the channel in Gaul and Germany. In 359/360, shipments of sorely needed British grain were procured to supply the harassed army and civilians on the Rhine. By the late Roman period, British woollen textiles also were valued exports. Under Septimius Severus (193-211), the island was split into two provinces: Britannia Superior and Britannia Inferior. During the reign of Diocletian (284-305), the two British provinces were further divided into four: Britannia Prima, Maxima Caesariensis, Britannia Secunda and Flavia Caesariensis. The capitals of these provinces were Corinium (Cirencester), Londinum (London), Eboracum (York) and Lindum (Lincoln) respectively.

Province Description Location Camulodunum
Camulodunum (Pleiades)
Location Description Camulodunum began as an Iron Age settlement defended by dykes, a combination of V-shaped ditch and rampart created by the upcast earth. It extended from the Roman river on the south to the Colne on the north, a distance of some four kilometers. Within this larger area, a legionary fort was built after the Claudian conquest of Britain in AD 43. On the site of the fort, a veteran colony was planted in about AD 49 and given the name Colonia Victricensis, City of Victory. It became the first provincial capital, later superseded by Londinium (London). Outside its walls was a V-shaped defensive ditch.
Garden Suburban Gardens in Camulodunum
Keywords archaeological garden ditches villae suburbanae Garden Description Outside the walls of the city, utilitarian gardens were planted, possibly in the 3rd century, in allotments along the road leading to the Balkerne Gate. Upon the widening of the defensive ditch at the foot of the walls around AD 275, a thick dump of soil was deposited on these garden allotments, preserving a short stretch of mounded cultivation beds laid out in rows. The excavators have suggested that the beds might have been formed for growing vines or plants such as asparagus. It is uncertain whether the gardens were attached to suburban dwellings at this time, but by about 300 practically all suburban houses in this area had been demolished without replacement.

Location Delos
Delos (Pleiades)
Location Description Delos is a small island in the center of the Cyclades measuring about five kilometers north-south and 1.3 kilometers east-west at the widest. In antiquity, it was famous as the birthplace of Apollo. Apollo’s sanctuary, founded in the seventh century B.C., is situated on a small plain next to the main port. It became a principal Panhellenic cult center and always formed the heart of the later settlement and city. The city was under Athenian supremacy in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. and became independent only in 314 B.C. Although extensive public building occurred during the period of its status as an independent city-state and the island began to develop as a commercial center, the city remained relatively small and was still mainly engaged in local and regional trade with the surrounding Cycladic islands. This changed significantly when the Romans handed control of Delos to Athens in 167 B.C. and declared it a free port. It soon developed into a booming cosmopolitan trade center with merchants coming from all over the Mediterranean world. As a consequence the city grew considerably, mostly to meet the needs of its new purpose. Squares, quays, warehouses, shops, new residential quarters, and clubhouses of foreign associations were constructed, and public buildings and sanctuaries were either renovated and extended or newly built. Although Delos was sacked twice, in 88 B.C. by the troops of Mithridates and 69 B.C. by the pirates under Athenodoros, its desertion during the first century B.C. is predominantly due to the rivalry of increasingly successful Roman ports like Puteoli and Ostia. Life in Delos did not come to an abrupt halt as evidenced by remains of Roman thermae and several Christian basilicas, but it continued on a much smaller scale.
Garden Agora of the Italians
Keywords colonnades courtyards exedrae (site elements) niches peristyles (Roman courtyards) porticoes water wells Garden Description The Agora of the Italians, with a size of some 6,000 square meters, is situated prominently in the center of Delos, between the famous sanctuary of Apollo to the south and the Sacred Lake to the north. The design of the Agora centers on a vast courtyard with four double-storied porticoes enclosing 3,450 square meters of an open unpaved terrain (Figs. 1-4). The colonnades are surrounded by the following rooms: (a) a series of three large exedrae (15, 30, 42) and four small exedrae (10, 23, 46, 98), which were all accessible by large thresholds on the ground floor level, with the exception of the raised exedra 98; (b) 27 rectangular (7, 9, 13, 18, 24, 32, 37, 39, 41, 44, 47, 54, 59, 97, 102, 105) and semicircular (16, 25, 30b, 34, 35, 68, 73, 90, 93, 95, 100) statue niches on all sides, which were not accessible, as their openings were closed by doors or grills and the thresholds of many were raised far above the ground floor level; (c) a bath suite with two round sweat baths in the north-west (27-31); (d) a group of three rooms in the west (20-22); and (e) two latrines to the west (5) and east (64). Access to the building is provided by a Doric propylon to the west (3) and two narrow side entrances to the west (2) and the east (70). Two rows of shops bordering the east and south porticoes as well as a row of shops on the northwestern corner of the building do not open to the interior of the Agora, but face the surrounding streets.
The building was erected on the former site of the so-called Sacred Lake, a huge swamp varying over time in size and water level. On the arid island of Delos, this was one of the most humid and fertile places. While the building site for the Agora was drained and stabilized with huge deposits of debris, the Sacred Lake was canalized with an exterior wall, thereby attaining its present form. The Agora itself was neither planned nor constructed in its present form, but is the result of a long building process with about five phases. The original building (Fig. 4) comprised only the large courtyard with double-storied porticoes, the three large lavish Ionic exedrae (15, 30, 42) in the west and north, the propylon (3) and the secondary entrance (2) in the west, and – as a result of the use of earlier walls – some rooms in the west (1, 18/20, 21, 28). The rows of the southern and eastern shops formed part of the original plan, but were only added subsequently in a second phase. In contrast to these, the small exedrae (10, 23, 46, 98), the statue niches, and the bath suite did not belong to the first plan, but were added in a third and fourth phase as a kind of makeshift arrangement and as a reaction to changing needs. In a fifth phase the northwestern shops were gained at the expense of public land.
The Agora of the Italians was most probably constructed between 130-120 B.C., partly destroyed during the raids of 88 B.C., then repaired, and finally abandoned after 69 B.C. Its function is contested, with identifications ranging from a multifunctional commercial meeting place for the Romans and Italians, a slave market, a commercial agora or macellum, a combined palaestra-gladiatorial arena-bath complex to, most recently, a garden-porticus, i.e., a luxurious park-like meeting place with a garden, porticoes, and exedrae.
The exploration of the vast courtyard during the early excavations between 1877 and 1905 was considered disappointing because very few objects were found. Large parts of the courtyard seem to have been dug up, but remains of plants, shrubs or trees were not recorded because they were probably not recognized or of sufficient interest. To this day, the courtyard is often overgrown with plants, flowers, and small trees. Future specialized investigation of the courtyard might definitely prove the existence of plants, but for the moment the following evidence for a garden can be cited.
The courtyard contained perhaps as many as eight wells, three of which are still visible today and five of which were tentatively identified in recent geophysical examinations. The area of the former swamp was still sufficiently humid and could have supplied the necessary water for plants. Although many Hellenistic squares and agorai were not paved, the lack of a pavement is remarkable within the context of Delos. In the last third of the second century B.C. all heavily frequented squares, streets, and quays, which were especially used for commerce and trade, were fully paved with large gneiss slabs. Since the Italians spared no expenses in constructing their first agora or in embellishing it later on, the unpaved floor of the courtyard cannot be due to financial shortcomings, but must have been chosen deliberately to meet a specific purpose. The courtyard lacks a sewer to dispose of waste and especially rain water. The wastewater of the later bath suite (room 27) was not emptied into the sewer of the nearby street, as usual, but was instead drained into the courtyard. Therefore, all available water seems to have been deliberately used to irrigate a garden. Comparisons with other buildings show that the original building of the Agora of the Italians has nothing in common with civic-political agorai, or specific commercial markets, or palaestrae, but resembles much larger ambulatory garden-peristyles of Hellenistic palaces (e.g. Aigai, Pella, Jericho) and Late Republican houses in the Vesuvian area or the lavish garden-porticus in Rome such as the Porticus Pompei and the Porticus Liviae. Like these, the Agora of the Italians was most probably conceived and used as a public park for all kinds of agreeable meetings and sojourns.
The porticoes, and maybe even the courtyard, were decorated with statues. Most of the nearly 240 sculptural fragments found within the confines and in the immediate neighborhood of the Agora seem to come from honorary statues, which were mostly presented in the rectangular and semicircular statue niches, but also outside of them, probably in the porticoes. However, some fragments belonged to historical-political monuments (e.g., at least two or even as many as six statues of Celts) and to decorative sculpture suited for a garden (e.g., Dionysos, Satyr/Apollo/Pothos, herms). These statues could have been placed either in the porticoes or in the courtyard.
Finally, numerous Greek, Latin, and bilingual inscriptions attest that the Agora of the Italians was never referred to as an agora, but probably as a pastas italike (as restored in Roussel and Launey, Inscriptions de Délos, no. 2612). The Latin translation of this could have been porticus Italica or porticus Italicorum which would have more appropriate for a luxurious garden-portico, rather than the agora or forum.

Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.

THUBURBO MAIUS (Henchir Kasbat), Tunisia (Pleiades)
Location Description The city occupies the slopes of a hill in a fertile grain producing area about 50 kilometers to the south of Tunis. Originally a settlement of mercenary soldiers after the fall of Carthage, it was raised to amunicipium by Hadrian (117-138), and to a colony during therein of Commodus (177-192). The chief public buildings and the most beautiful homes date from this period. After the crisis of the Empire during the third century, Thuburbo saw a rebirth in the fourth century; but as imperial authority declined the city became a mere village.
Garden East Temple (Temple de l&amp;rsquo;Est)
Keywords [temple] mosaics (visual works) [root cavities] [temple garden] [grove] [garden soil] Garden Description A strip of soil bordered most of the long sides of the temple and the mosaic paving in front of it (Plan view, Fig. 1). Preliminary excavations in 1990 in a strip 1m wide at the front of the garden, on the left, yielded a row of root cavities approximately 15cm in diameter and 50-70cm apart suggesting a formal planting. The size of the root cavities indicates that trees or large shrubs, perhaps laurels, were planted there. Temple gardens and groves are well known in the ancient world, primarily from literary evidence, but there is little archaeological evidence. For this reason the complete excavation of both strips of soil is extremely important. The soil in the preceding temples should also be excavated.

Garden House of Bacchus and Ariadne (Maison de Bacchus et Ariane)
Keywords domus peristyle houses insulae mosaics (visual works) triclinia (rooms) [semicircular basin] [root cavities] [pipe] [pool] [fountain] [pits] Garden Description This large house, occupying most of an insula (excavated in l925), dates in its present form from the early fifth century. The SW part of the house was devoted to business, the production of olive oil.
The rooms on the NE side of the residence area were arranged around a peristyle garden. The mosaic of Bacchus and Ariadne in the large room opening off of the NW portico gave the house its name. The bottom of the semicircular basin projecting into the garden opposite this room was decorated with a wavy water motif; the interior was decorated with plants and imitation marble. This part of the house would have been used by the family and the rooms on the SW for more personal purposes (Plan view, Fig.1). Preliminary excavations in this garden revealed a row of cavities along the southern edge of the garden. Roots arranged in a straight row suggest a produce garden.
The courtyard garden, opposite the handsome triclinium, was located three steps below the triclinium. The triclinium had a view on the garden, impressively framed by two columns. The location of a garden opposite an important room is typical in houses of the African provinces. The semicircular mosaic pool (2.20 m in diameter, 1.10 m deep), which projected into the garden, was decorated on the bottom with the head of Oceanus. A pipe indicated where a fountain had jetted from his mouth.
When the 25-30 cm of soil that had accumulated through the centuries, probably transplanted by the wind, was removed in 1990, evidence of the plantings at the last occupation level was perfectly preserved. The soil that formed when the roots decayed was of an entirely different texture and color from that of the surrounding soil (Fig. 2), making the shape of the ancient roots at ground level as distinct as those of lapilli-filled cavities in the Vesuvian area. There were six large tree-root cavities, the largest dimension at ground level 30-50 cm in diameter, three smaller tree root cavities 18-20 cm in diameter, and many smaller cavities most of which were 5-10 cm in diameter (Fig. 3). Three large rectangular areas, approximately the same size (36 x 72 cm, 40 x 60 cm and 46 x 63 cm) and only a few cm deep, represented decayed wood, the two in the rear garden were probably the wooden bases of a garden bench or table. The one in the back of the mosaic fountain in full view of the triclinium perhaps supported a small table (Fig. 4-5).
Numerous olive pits and bones that showed evidence of burning were found in an area (ca 32 x 45 cm) near the rear of the garden, some on the surface, some shallowly buried. Nearby, in a place where there had been frequent fires, were more shallowly buried bones. Of the 34 bones found, five were those of pig (Sus scrofa L), eight were of sheep (Ovis aries L.) or domestic goat (Capra hirca L.), one was from a rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus L.), and one from a carnivore (cf. Felis catus L.), probably a pet cat. The other bones were too badly broken to be identifiable. An apricot pit was found near the large tree-root cavity in the south corner of the garden.
The location of the cooking area behind the bench or table is logical. Homes at Thuburbo had no kitchens, and cooking was done in the garden. Servants would have cooked the food at the rear of the garden, using the table or bench (which was screened by plantings) for both supplies and cooking food, preparatory to serving guests in the formal triclinium. At other times, during the hot summer the family, and perhaps a few special guests, enjoyed meals in the garden. When the accumulated bones became a problem, they were raked into the fire, and those not burned were shallowly buried, as was the common Roman practice.
The gardens in Tunisia were not preserved at an exact moment in history, as were those in the Vesuvian area. The trees and shrubs in Tunisian gardens would have continued to grow for some time after the site was abandoned. What was uncovered in 1990 was not the garden at its prime. Some of the smaller roots may have been those of seedlings that grew from unpicked fruit that fell from the trees.
The trees in this garden were probably food bearing trees. Ancient Tunisia had few other trees. They knew the palm, pine and cypress, but these trees would have been overpowering in such a small garden. The two large tree-root cavities (on the right in Fig. 3) are the proper size and shape for olive trees. The middle tree on the left was perhaps a fig tree; the tree in the south corner of the garden may have been an apricot. The smaller trees were probably fruit or nut trees. The ancient Tunisians knew the quince, pomegranate, plum, citron, peach, apple, pear and grape – all pictured in the mosaics. There may also have been a few grapes raised for table use in this garden.
We next consider the identity of the many smaller roots. Since this garden was viewed from the large formal dining room, an effort would have been made to make it beautiful all year round. Fruit trees would have been beautiful in flower or fruit but they are deciduous. Only the olive tree is evergreen. Ornamental plant material in ancient Roman gardens was extremely limited, but the majority of the plants were evergreen and produced beautiful gardens in every season, welcome in winter and refreshingly cool in summer. The plant material in Tunisia was limited for the most part to the laurel, myrtle, rosemary, laurustinus, oleander, acanthus and ivy. There does not seem to be a place in this garden for ivy, but any of the other plants could have been used. Roman gardens had few flowers, especially with color. Roses are pictured in Tunisian mosaics and they may have been used in this garden. The oleander (Nerium oleander L.) with its striking pink flowers is the only colorful garden shrub. It is widespread in all Tunisia and tolerant of variable growing conditions. It seems probable that oleanders, so prominent in modern Tunisian gardens, as well as in the wild, also added color to this garden.

Location Delos
Delos (Pleiades)
Location Description Delos is a small island in the center of the Cyclades measuring about five kilometers north-south and 1.3 kilometers east-west at the widest. In antiquity, it was famous as the birthplace of Apollo. Apollo’s sanctuary, founded in the seventh century B.C., is situated on a small plain next to the main port. It became a principal Panhellenic cult center and always formed the heart of the later settlement and city. The city was under Athenian supremacy in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. and became independent only in 314 B.C. Although extensive public building occurred during the period of its status as an independent city-state and the island began to develop as a commercial center, the city remained relatively small and was still mainly engaged in local and regional trade with the surrounding Cycladic islands. This changed significantly when the Romans handed control of Delos to Athens in 167 B.C. and declared it a free port. It soon developed into a booming cosmopolitan trade center with merchants coming from all over the Mediterranean world. As a consequence the city grew considerably, mostly to meet the needs of its new purpose. Squares, quays, warehouses, shops, new residential quarters, and clubhouses of foreign associations were constructed, and public buildings and sanctuaries were either renovated and extended or newly built. Although Delos was sacked twice, in 88 B.C. by the troops of Mithridates and 69 B.C. by the pirates under Athenodoros, its desertion during the first century B.C. is predominantly due to the rivalry of increasingly successful Roman ports like Puteoli and Ostia. Life in Delos did not come to an abrupt halt as evidenced by remains of Roman thermae and several Christian basilicas, but it continued on a much smaller scale.
Garden Peristyle Gardens
Keywords impluvia nymphaea (garden structures) oeci peristyles (Roman courtyards) Garden Description In the Late Hellenistic houses of Delos the impluvia of peristyle courtyards were usually paved, and rainwater falling into these courtyards was emptied as wastewater by sewers into nearby streets. However, in two large houses (Quarter of the Theater, Insula II, Houses E and F) and two clubhouses of associations (House of Fourni; Quarter of the Stadium, Insula I, building B, the so-called perfumery) the impluvia of the peristyle courtyards were not paved, with the exception of some scattered stone settings. Whereas one of them might have been left unfinished in a phase of remodeling (Quarter of the Theater, insula II, House F), the others were certainly all used, comprising of different phases of enlargement and embellishment. Thus, the lack of pavement cannot be due to the unfinished state of the buildings, but must have been deliberate. The sizes of these impluvia range from 30.20 square meters to 75.80 square meters. In all cases no cistern was established under the impluvium, as is usual in Delian buildings with peristyles. Furthermore, all four peristyle courtyards are provided with a sewer for the drainage of rain and waste water; the earthen floor of the impluvium could probably not absorb the occasional large quantities of rain water pouring down in heavy storms, so that at least some of the rain water had to be drained away. So far, planting was only proposed for the courtyard of the so-called perfumery, but no specialized examinations or excavations were performed in any of the four courtyards. In addition to the above-mentioned characteristics, some other features might speak in favor of luxurious garden-peristyles for these Delian buildings. In Delian private buildings, peristyle gardens were probably introduced rather late, during the heyday of the free port in the three or four decades before 88 B.C. Within the local context, the Agora of the Italians could have served as the most immediate model for this new fashion. The design of these gardens would have been simple. They would have consisted mostly of small trees, shrubs, and plants, which did not need much water. All of them had to be irrigated by hand, like the garden of the Agora of the Italians and many of the kitchen and commercial gardens, as Late Hellenistic Delos was not provided with a water pipe system.
The core building of the House of Fourni is arranged along a main axis with rooms on at least three different levels (Fig. 1). The main rooms were not oriented towards the south, as is usual in Delos, but towards the west, thus providing a view of the nearby bay of Fourni and the sea. A kind of nymphaeum (k), carved out of the natural rock and placed exactly on the main axis of the building, was added subsequently to the eastern façade of the building. A broad staircase led from the impluvium of the courtyard (q) to a large raised room in the east (j), a remarkably open oecus maior with doors on three sides and an opening to the nymphaeum on the fourth side. Therefore, the impluvium of 75.80 square meters will have been frequently used and would certainly have been paved, had it not been conceived for a special purpose like planting. Today, the courtyard is (again?) covered with small shrubs. The overall design and some other features like opus signinum pavements (rooms i, h and o) and ‘liturgical’ paintings for the cult of the lares compitales, a cult usually performed by slaves and liberti of Italians or Romans, point to a Roman or Italian association, which might have introduced some new fashionable traits into Delian private architecture.

Africa proconsularis (Pleiades)
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.

Location Description The city occupies the slopes of a hill in a fertile grain producing area about 50 kilometers to the south of Tunis. Originally a settlement of mercenary soldiers after the fall of Carthage, it was raised to amunicipium by Hadrian (117-138), and to a colony during therein of Commodus (177-192). The chief public buildings and the most beautiful homes date from this period. After the crisis of the Empire during the third century, Thuburbo saw a rebirth in the fourth century; but as imperial authority declined the city became a mere village.

The Trifolium sector, was laid out around a peristyle garden (I-V) enclosed on four sides by a portico of 12 columns. The garden, 35 cm lower than the level of the portico, had a deep rectangular pool (1) and a semicircular basin (2, 3) placed at each end of the garden on the axis of the oecus (XI). Eight ceramic vases (8 cm in dia., 30 cm deep) embedded in the sides of the pool provided places for the fish to lay eggs and served as shady retreats for the fish. The pool and the basins were paved with mosaics. These have been mostly destroyed, but pieces of the bottom paving of the basin (3) show birds and a hare among cut branches of flowers.

Location Delos
Delos (Pleiades)
Location Description Delos is a small island in the center of the Cyclades measuring about five kilometers north-south and 1.3 kilometers east-west at the widest. In antiquity, it was famous as the birthplace of Apollo. Apollo’s sanctuary, founded in the seventh century B.C., is situated on a small plain next to the main port. It became a principal Panhellenic cult center and always formed the heart of the later settlement and city. The city was under Athenian supremacy in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. and became independent only in 314 B.C. Although extensive public building occurred during the period of its status as an independent city-state and the island began to develop as a commercial center, the city remained relatively small and was still mainly engaged in local and regional trade with the surrounding Cycladic islands. This changed significantly when the Romans handed control of Delos to Athens in 167 B.C. and declared it a free port. It soon developed into a booming cosmopolitan trade center with merchants coming from all over the Mediterranean world. As a consequence the city grew considerably, mostly to meet the needs of its new purpose. Squares, quays, warehouses, shops, new residential quarters, and clubhouses of foreign associations were constructed, and public buildings and sanctuaries were either renovated and extended or newly built. Although Delos was sacked twice, in 88 B.C. by the troops of Mithridates and 69 B.C. by the pirates under Athenodoros, its desertion during the first century B.C. is predominantly due to the rivalry of increasingly successful Roman ports like Puteoli and Ostia. Life in Delos did not come to an abrupt halt as evidenced by remains of Roman thermae and several Christian basilicas, but it continued on a much smaller scale.

Keywords inscriptions market gardens Garden Description The inscriptions of the sanctuary of Apollo mention nearly 30 kepoi within the period of 433 B.C. to 156/155 B.C., which were either private or belonged to Apollo and were rented or leased. Most of these cannot be localized because they were named after their former owners and with topographical references or surnames unknown today. However, in the years between 167 and 155 B.C., three kepoi were situated near identified buildings: the sanctuary of Leto, the Hippodrome, and the Neorion. A fourth was located near the palaestra, the identification of which among the several palaestra-buildings in Delos is contested. The first three kepoi were located east of the sanctuary of Apollo in a zone which was regarded as specifically humid and fertile because the Inopos, the main watercourse of Delos, was believed to have passed here before emptying into the Bay of Skardhana to the north. However, it has been shown that the Inopos ended south of the sanctuary of Apollo and could therefore never have irrigated the potential garden zone east of Apollo’s sacred precinct.
The kepoi were certainly always located outside the residential quarters and were used as kitchen or commercial gardens. They were identified as terrain for the cultivation of plants that needed irrigation, such as vines, olives, and figs. This terrain had to be enclosed by walls or fences to keep animals out. In contrast to the kepoi, the choria equally mentioned in the inscriptions of the sanctuary of Apollo served for the growing of cereals and stock farming. According to this definition, kepoi could have been laid out either next to farmhouses serving as kitchen gardens or on some of the many cultural terraces which extended far beyond the center of the city to the south, north, and east of the residential zones (Fig. 1). The necessary water supply was provided by wells, reservoirs, and large pools, some of which have been discovered on these terraces. The water was either distributed by hand or through a system of irrigation channels, starting from one of the reservoirs or large pools.
The variety of trees and plants cultivated in ancient Delos is known from the epigraphic evidence. Among the sporadically listed plants are pomegranates, apples, laurel, almonds, palms, vines, figs, and olives. Fig trees, which to this day form the majority of the Delian tree population, appear most often in the inscriptions.

Location Delos
Delos (Pleiades)
Location Description Delos is a small island in the center of the Cyclades measuring about five kilometers north-south and 1.3 kilometers east-west at the widest. In antiquity, it was famous as the birthplace of Apollo. Apollo’s sanctuary, founded in the seventh century B.C., is situated on a small plain next to the main port. It became a principal Panhellenic cult center and always formed the heart of the later settlement and city. The city was under Athenian supremacy in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. and became independent only in 314 B.C. Although extensive public building occurred during the period of its status as an independent city-state and the island began to develop as a commercial center, the city remained relatively small and was still mainly engaged in local and regional trade with the surrounding Cycladic islands. This changed significantly when the Romans handed control of Delos to Athens in 167 B.C. and declared it a free port. It soon developed into a booming cosmopolitan trade center with merchants coming from all over the Mediterranean world. As a consequence the city grew considerably, mostly to meet the needs of its new purpose. Squares, quays, warehouses, shops, new residential quarters, and clubhouses of foreign associations were constructed, and public buildings and sanctuaries were either renovated and extended or newly built. Although Delos was sacked twice, in 88 B.C. by the troops of Mithridates and 69 B.C. by the pirates under Athenodoros, its desertion during the first century B.C. is predominantly due to the rivalry of increasingly successful Roman ports like Puteoli and Ostia. Life in Delos did not come to an abrupt halt as evidenced by remains of Roman thermae and several Christian basilicas, but it continued on a much smaller scale.
Garden Peristyle Gardens
Keywords impluvia nymphaea (garden structures) oeci peristyles (Roman courtyards) Garden Description In the Late Hellenistic houses of Delos the impluvia of peristyle courtyards were usually paved, and rainwater falling into these courtyards was emptied as wastewater by sewers into nearby streets. However, in two large houses (Quarter of the Theater, Insula II, Houses E and F) and two clubhouses of associations (House of Fourni; Quarter of the Stadium, Insula I, building B, the so-called perfumery) the impluvia of the peristyle courtyards were not paved, with the exception of some scattered stone settings. Whereas one of them might have been left unfinished in a phase of remodeling (Quarter of the Theater, insula II, House F), the others were certainly all used, comprising of different phases of enlargement and embellishment. Thus, the lack of pavement cannot be due to the unfinished state of the buildings, but must have been deliberate. The sizes of these impluvia range from 30.20 square meters to 75.80 square meters. In all cases no cistern was established under the impluvium, as is usual in Delian buildings with peristyles. Furthermore, all four peristyle courtyards are provided with a sewer for the drainage of rain and waste water; the earthen floor of the impluvium could probably not absorb the occasional large quantities of rain water pouring down in heavy storms, so that at least some of the rain water had to be drained away. So far, planting was only proposed for the courtyard of the so-called perfumery, but no specialized examinations or excavations were performed in any of the four courtyards. In addition to the above-mentioned characteristics, some other features might speak in favor of luxurious garden-peristyles for these Delian buildings. In Delian private buildings, peristyle gardens were probably introduced rather late, during the heyday of the free port in the three or four decades before 88 B.C. Within the local context, the Agora of the Italians could have served as the most immediate model for this new fashion. The design of these gardens would have been simple. They would have consisted mostly of small trees, shrubs, and plants, which did not need much water. All of them had to be irrigated by hand, like the garden of the Agora of the Italians and many of the kitchen and commercial gardens, as Late Hellenistic Delos was not provided with a water pipe system.
The so-called perfumery was equipped with a Rhodian peristyle (e), an open oecus maior with colonnades and doors on all four sides (m-n), and with a kind of nymphaeum-reservoir (p) (Figs. 1, 2). The latter opened off the oecus maior and was placed on the visual axis of the main entrance. Perfume was produced in a large exedra (f), which was connected with the peristyle to its north by an Ionic colonnade. The overall design is as unique as in the House of Fourni and could well have comprised a peristyle with a stylish garden of 51.20 square meters. A Roman or Italian association might have owned this clubhouse because Romans and Italians showed particular interest in the perfume trade. Slaves and liberti of several gentes that are attested in Delos distinguished themselves as thurarii (dealers of incense) in the Mediterranean world.

All of them had to be irrigated by hand, like the garden of the Agora of the Italians and many of the kitchen and commercial gardens, as Late Hellenistic Delos was not provided with a water pipe system.
The three-sided peristyle in the courtyard (b) of House E in the insula II of the Quarter of the theater comprised a large rectangular altar in its center (Figs. 1, 2). An exedra with two columns (f) opened to the north and was only accessible via the impluvium. Again, this arrangement would have required frequent use of the impluvium and, therefore, even more so its systematic pavement. Instead, the impluvium of 48.80 square meters, which is only equipped with some scattered stone slabs, was probably transformed into a kind of sacred garden. Two altars at either side of the entrance, which were probably combined with ‘liturgical’ paintings, might indicate that a Roman or Italian owned this house at least for a certain period.
Whether the impluvium of 30.20 square meters (a) of House F in insula II of the Quarter of the Theater was left unfinished or planned or even realized as a garden, cannot be decided (Figs. 1, 3). Following the latest fashion, the initiators of the last major transformation of this house might well have conceived of a planted impluvium. This house, however, was not (yet?) equipped with any water supply.

Arabia (province) (Pleiades)
The history of Roman Arabia begins with the death of the Nabataean king, Rabb&amp;rsquo;el II soter, in 106 CE. The emperor Trajan annexed the Nabataean kingdom and organized its territory within the new Roman province of Arabia Petraea that occupied a large area of northwestern Arabia, extending from the Hauran in the north, to the Negev and Sinai deserts in the west, and into the northern Hejaz in the south. The administrative district of Perea, formerly under the Herodian dynasty was also added. The provincial capital of Arabia Petraea was located at Bostra which replaced Petra as the capital of Nabataea in the last decades of that kingdom’s independence. Petra continued to function as an important cultural, political and economic center of the province for at least a century following annexation. During the early Byzantine period (4th-6th centuries CE), the major cities of the Roman era continued to flourish, and Christianity gradually became the accepted religion of the area. Petra remained an important center in the early Byzantine period when it was inhabited by a substantial Christian community and was the seat of a bishopric.
The region of Arabia Petraea is primarily a desert environment that belongs to the eastern Mediterranean weather system. Its inhabitants experienced marked seasonal contrasts with dry, hot summers and cold, wet winters. Rainfall occurs during the winter months and ranges from over 600 millimeters in the north-west to as low as 100 millimeters in the south and east of the region.
Location Petra
Petra (Pleiades)
Petra is located approximately 80 kilometers southeast of the Dead Sea in modern Jordan. The ancient city is situated on the western slopes of the Sharā Mountain Range, in a wide basin surrounded by deeply eroded mountainous ridges of sandstone, with outcrops of limestone and porphyry that form a natural fortification.
The development of Petra as an important political, economic, and cultural center in the Near East during the Hellenistic-Roman periods (1st century BCE-2nd century CE) was ultimately the result of its strategic position on the crossroads of the major trade and communication routes that crossed the region (Fig. 1). Wadi Mousa, the narrow valley along which Petra developed, provided one of the few convenient and negotiable routes through the mountainous barrier allowing caravans to pass between the high desert plateau to the east and Wādī ʻAraba to the west. This strategic position on the crossroads of the desert trade routes made it possible for the inhabitants of Petra to establish control over the caravans that traveled between Arabia and the Mediterranean.
Sublocation Southern Terrace
The Southern Terrace is a series of monumental built terraces constructed along the Colonnaded Street on the southern slope of Wadi Musa, which bisects the city center of Petra. In the early 20th century, prior to the onset of archaeological excavations, the major components of the Southern Terrace were assigned the names (from west to east) the &amp;ldquo;Great Temple&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;Lower Market&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;Middle Market,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Upper Market.&amp;rdquo; The &amp;ldquo;Lower Market&amp;rdquo; has since been identified as a garden and pool complex and the author proposes that it is one component of a large palatial complex that occupied the entirety of the Southern Terrace and dominated the City Center (Figs. 2 and 5).
Garden Petra Garden and Pool Complex
Keywords archaeobotany artificial islands castelli aquae colonnades exedrae (site elements) garden pavilions horticultural containers pergolas terrace gardens water features (landscaping) Garden Description The only example of a garden investigated using specialized garden archaeology techniques in the region of Arabia Petraea is found at Petra. A large open area was believed to be the site of a marketplace, the so-called “Lower Market,” until excavations revealed the remnants of a formal garden and pool complex. The garden is situated on an artificial terrace on the southern slope of the Wadi Musa, overlooking the main colonnaded street and flanked by the so-called “Middle Market” to the east, and the Great Temple complex to the west. To the south of the garden is a residential quarter on top of a high sandstone ridge (Ez-Zantur), where several private villas have been excavated (Fig. 5). Primary access into the garden was apparently from the west, through a triple colonnade that marks the boundary between the Great Temple’s “lower temenos” and the garden terrace.
The garden is composed of two distinct parts: on the north is a large earthen terrace that is elevated approximately six meters above the main street and is level with the Great Temple’s “lower temenos”; to the south of the earthen terrace and elevated another two and a half meters above it is a monumental pool with a central island-pavilion (Fig. 3). A metrological analysis of the site reveals that the Roman pes was employed in the layout of the garden terrace and pool.
The garden’s earthen terrace measures 65 by 53 meters and is supported on the north by a double retaining wall. Prior to archaeological study of the site, the terrace appeared devoid of visible architectural features, with the exception of a short stretch of a low wall at its center. The terrace’s southwest quarter has a raised earthen area, bounded on the north and west by reused architectural fragments, attesting to the modern use of the site as an agricultural field by the local Bedouin inhabitants of Petra.
The application of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) provided valuable information about the buried garden (Fig 4). It revealed that the terrace is primarily earthen with a series of stone structures aligned along its central north-south axis. Follow-up excavations uncovered two stone platforms—one at the center of the terrace and one several meters to the south, between the central platform and the pool. Each platform is constructed of a core of unhewn fieldstones faced with sandstone ashlars, typical of Nabataean masonry. There is also evidence that the southern platform was enlarged and redesigned, probably during the Roman and Byzantine periods. At the northern end of the terrace, aligned with the platforms, two soundings exposed the foundations of a large structure that appeared as a pronounced rectangular stone outline (ca. 8.5 x 11 meters) in the GPR data. The gravel interior floor surface and lack of evidence for substantial walls or a roof suggest that it was an open structure, perhaps a pergola, designed to provide shade while viewing the surrounding garden. Remnants of a gravel pathway were uncovered along the central east-west axis in Trench 17 (Fig. 6). The pathway’s border is defined by the foundations of a stylobate, suggesting a colonnaded or trellised walkway with bays for constructed views of the garden (Fig. 7). Fragments of a planting pot (Fig. 8), perforated for drainage and aeration, were found near the pathway along with several root cavities, which provide evidence for plantings along the path’s edge. A similar planting pot fragment was uncovered during preliminary excavations in the so-called “Upper Market” in 2009 (Alcock et al. 2010: fig. 13.2) and may be indicative of a second garden site on Petra&amp;rsquo;s Southern Terrace.
Soil samples taken from the garden terrace produced archaeobotanical specimens for analysis. The data from the macrobotanical remains conducted by Jennifer H. Ramsey (Table 1) can tell us little about the plants growing in the Petra Garden but does identify the types of plants – grape vines, and fruit and nut trees – that would be expected to be growing in a pleasure garden in the Hellenistic/Roman Near East and depicted in a frescoe in the &amp;ldquo;Painted House&amp;rdquo; at nearby Siq al-Barid (&amp;ldquo;Little Petra&amp;rdquo;) (Fig. 9). A phytolith study conducted by Carlos E. Cordova has shown evidence for date palm trees (Phoenix dactylifera) and the presence of Panicoideae grasses which grow only in the summertime in wet areas and therefore suggests frequent irrigation of the gardens during the dry, hot summers. The cereal and weed taxa identified in the macrobotanical remains (Table 1) are interpreted as evidence for what was happening in the larger agrarian landscape of the site and the region.
To the south of the garden terrace, the sandstone hillside was quarried out to create a space for a monumental pool encircled by a promenade that is elevated 2.5 meters above the garden. A staircase provides access from the southwest corner of the garden terrace to the pool&amp;rsquo;s west promenade (Fig. 3). The area of the pool-complex measures 65 x 32 meters and is bounded on the south and east by vertical sandstone escarpments rising up to 16 meters above pool-level; to the west is the Eastern Perimeter Wall of the Great Temple complex. The pool is a monumental construction with massive walls built to hold approximately 2069 cubic meters (547,000 gallons) of water. Stretching at least forty-six meters across the width of the site, the pool’s north wall measures three and a half meters wide and is preserved to a height of six courses (2.2 m). The wall’s exterior face is constructed of close-fitting sandstone ashlars typical of Nabataean masonry; between them are alternating rows of roughly hewn sandstone blocks and rubble, bonded into a solid mass with an impervious white mortar. Large rectangular pavers preserved in situ indicate there was once a nicely paved promenade around the pool’s perimeter. Porticoed promenades were commonly associated with ornamental pools of the Hellenistic and Roman periods. To the rear of the pool, a screen wall masks the quarried face of the naturally veined bedrock and displays a central niche and flanking exedrae (only the western exedra has been excavated) that provide focal points at different locations around the pool.
The interior dimensions of the open-air pool measures 43 x 23 meters, and it is two and a half meters deep. Its interior walls and floor are lined with a thick coat of concrete such as is typically used to line Nabataean reservoirs and cisterns. A stone staircase is built into the northeast corner to facilitate entrance into the pool. At the center of the pool is an island-pavilion perched on top of a massive stone plinth (8.5 x 11 x 2.5 m). The pavilion is rectangular in plan with broad, open doorways on at least three sides. Interior columns with marble-faced bases supported the pavilion’s roof. Numerous fragments of painted red stucco, as well as some blue and white, provide some indication of the pavilion’s decorative color scheme. An interior channel or drain cuts diagonally across the floor to connect with a channel that encircles the exterior perimeter of the pavilion, just above the maximum water level of the pool. It is likely that this exterior channel was originally capped and functioned as an overflow channel between pavilion and pool.
Excavations revealed an elaborate water distribution system incorporated into the design and construction of the pool. A holding tank perched on top of the eastern escarpment fed water to the pool and garden below. The pool’s north wall functioned as an aqueduct with channels and pipelines conducting water across the top of the wall to a castellum, or central holding tank and redistribution point built into the wall. Water then exited the castellum and was fed into stone channels that form part of an irrigation system for the garden that was laid out on the earthen terrace. In addition, two large capped channels cut into the bedrock along the eastern edge of the complex may be intended to direct excess or waste water into the wadi. What appears to be a large subterranean cistern fed and drained by pipelines has been identified through GPR in the southeastern quadrant of the terrace, but remains unexcavated.
The archaeological record indicates that the large terrace upon which the garden was found was constructed during the reign of the Nabataean king, Aretas IV (9 BCE – 40 CE) and thus it is believed that the garden and monumental pool were initially created at the end of the first century BCE or early first century CE The role of the garden and pool complex within Petra in this earliest phase remains ambiguous. The site is closely associated with the neighboring Great Temple complex. However, the original function of the Great Temple monument remains unsettled, with theories ranging from religious/sacred (temple) to private/royal (possibly a palace or audience hall). Close parallels found in the gardens and pools of the contemporary palaces in neighboring Judaea during the reign of the Hasmonean Dynasty (168-40 BCE) and Herod the Great (37-4 BCE) support the interpretation of the Petra garden as part of a palace complex.
The Petra garden continued in use after the Roman annexation of Petra in 106 CE, at which time the Great Temple was converted into an odeion or bouleutereion. It is likely that, within this context, the garden functioned as a public park much like the urban parks in contemporary Rome. Several examples of evidence for renovations have been identified with this phase of the site. For example, the addition of a bridge allowed easy access to the island-pavilion that was originally only accessible by swimming or possibly boating. In addition, a reorganization of the hydraulic system may represent a new approach to water consumption influenced by the Romans, whose rules about the use of natural resources differed from those of local inhabitants.
A deep deposit of sediment above the pool floor indicates that the pool went out of use or was not well-maintained for a period of time before the collapse of the pavilion walls into the pool as a result of the earthquake of 363 CE that caused much destruction in Petra. The remnants of later walls, evidence for the reuse of the hydraulic installations, and a raised field that occupies part of the earthen terrace, testify to the continued use of the site for agricultural purposes through the post-Roman occupation of Petra and into the modern era.

The history of Roman Arabia begins with the death of the Nabataean king, Rabb&amp;rsquo;el II soter, in A.D. 106. The emperor Trajan annexed the Nabataean kingdom and organized its territory within the new Roman province of Arabia Petraea that occupied a large area of northwestern Arabia, extending from the Hauran in the north, to the Negev and Sinai deserts in the west, and into the northern Hejaz in the south. The administrative district of Perea, formerly under the Herodian dynasty was also added. The provincial capital of Arabia Petraea was located at Bostra which replaced Petra as the capital of Nabataea in the last decades of that kingdom’s independence. Petra continued to function as an important cultural, political and economic center of the province for at least a century following annexation. During the early Byzantine period (4th-6th centuries CE), the major cities of the Roman era continued to flourish, and Christianity gradually became the accepted religion of the area. Petra remained an important center in the early Byzantine period when it was inhabited by a substantial Christian community and was the seat of a bishopric.
The region of Arabia Petraea is primarily a desert environment that belongs to the eastern Mediterranean weather system. Its inhabitants experienced marked seasonal contrasts with dry, hot summers and cold, wet winters. Rainfall occurs during the winter months and ranges from over 600 millimeters in the north-west to as low as 100 millimeters in the south and east of the region.
Location Auara
Auara (Pleiades)
Nabataean Hawara (Auara) was founded by king Aretas III in the early first century BCE as a trading post along the King&amp;rsquo;s Highway, midway between the Nabataean capital, Petra, and the port town of Aila on the Gulf of Aqaba (Fig. 1). In the early 2nd century CE, under Roman occupation, a fort was erected at the site (Roman Hauarra/Havarra) due to its strategic position on the major trade highway that was rebuilt as the Via Nova Traiana. Associated with the fort was a small town with a bathhouse and a community shrine.
Garden Shrine Complex in Insula E125
Keywords aqueducts baetyls basins (vessels) insulae naoi (chambers) planters (containers) shrines (structures) temene Garden Description A few decades after a Nabataean shrine (Fig. 2) at Hauarra had been severely damaged during the Roman conquest of Arabia Petraea, the site’s inhabitants built another shrine at the same location. The Roman-period shrine occupied the southeast corner of a multi-unit insula (E125), but could only be accessed from outside the complex. This shrine consisted of a square naos (containing a central Nabataean baetyl and legionary altar, bins, shelves, and votive offerings) enclosed in a rectangular open-air temenos (Fig. 3). Upon entering the temenos, worshippers walked to the naos along a 12.7 m long paved processional way that was flanked by two long raised planters. An aqueduct-fed basin next to the door of the naos appears to have supplied the shrine with so much fresh water that it must have been intended not just for ritual cleansing, but for supplying the planters as well. Given the relatively shallow depth of the planters, and that no root balls or pots were found within, they probably contained shrubs and/or flowers rather than trees. Although the architect clearly tried to make the planters symmetrical in size, shape, and location, their design (and that of the whole Roman shrine) was constrained by the reuse of some Nabataean walls as foundations.

Location Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Villa (Pleiades)
Location Description DESCRIPTION
Villa Adriana, erected by emperor Hadrian at the beginning of the II cent. A.D., occupies a vast area of 126 hectares. It was a beautiful estate strategically located near Tivoli and, at the same time, not very far from Rome (WINNEFELD 1895; KÄHLER 1950; AURIGEMMA 1961; RAKOB 1973; BROWN 1964). Prior to the Hadrianic settlement, an ancient villa, dating back to the late republican time, already stood there. Probably it belonged to Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s family and, as a matter of fact, many scholars think that Hadrian chose this estate as the ideal one because he already knew the place and was attached to it (LUGLI 1927). Certainly he preserved and restored the original building and made it the nucleus of his private quarters.
The realization of this magnificent residence must have been a cherished dream of Hadrian, and he must have planned it long before becoming an emperor. This is the only way to explain how the works for its construction began immediately after his election and his return to Rome in 118 A.D. Hadrian died in 138 A.D. when his ideal residence was nearly completed. Nearly, because there was still some work to be done. Some important halls of the Great Baths were not finished, and the model for a Stadium, found among the ruins of his last building-yard in the quarters of the stonecutters (CAPRINO 1996-97; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, p. 73; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 144-147; REGGIANI 1997), was never brought to the unknown place where Hadrian had planned to build it. The Emperor&amp;rsquo;s death put an abrupt end to all activities, and some of the gardens he planned to create, and for which fountains and pavilions had already been built, were never done or, if ever they were completed, seem to have been soon abandoned (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1992-93, pp. 000-000). As a matter of fact after him Villa Adriana was only partially lived in by his successors and was solely used for occasional visits. It became just one of the many country houses pertaining to the imperial praedia. Some of the existing gardens (Fig. 1), the ones nearer to the center of the residence and the monumental ones, were maintained and irrigated up to the end of the Roman Empire, a fact which is now proved by the concentration of extractable lead found in their soil, and which is due to the use of lead pipes for irrigation (FOSS ET ALII 1990; FOSS 1989-90; FOSS 1992; TIMPSON ET ALII 1994; FOSS, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1996). As a consequence of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s death, some others sites, which he had planned to be attractive and important, got no irrigation at all, thus their soil contains only a minimal quantity of extractable lead, about the same amount that is ordinarily found in modern agricultural fields.
Garden The gardens at the entrance of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s villa (Fig. 1, n. 3)
Keywords flower gardens peristyles (Roman courtyards) tufa Garden Description The Great Entrance Hall of Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s villa (Fig. 9) presents three gardens, two of which (Fig. 9, A and G) are peristyle ones.
a – The main gate to the Hadrianic residence opens up on a peristyle garden, the largest one. Having just been excavated by Dr. Anna Maria Reggiani, the Latium&amp;rsquo;s Superintendent, it is published by her at p. 000 .
b –The other garden (Figs. 9, G, and 10-11), set at the eastern side of the entrance hall, occupies a smaller peristyle with a curved side toward East (REICHARDT 1933). It was crossed in the middle by a path which had a round-shaped space in the center (SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987, pp. 175-178, figs. 13-20; JASHEMSKI, SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1987-88, p. 147, figs. 1-2; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 1998, pp. 364-366, fig. 1; MARI, REGGIANI, RIGHI 2000; SALZA PRINA RICOTTI 2000, pp. 323-324, fig. 110). Here some decorative element - a marble vase or a statue - was probably displayed. Two flowerbeds cut in the tufa flanked it (Figs. 10, G, and 11). We are still pretty sure that they were bordered by well-groomed box hedges, a kind of decoration which was afterwards inherited by the “all&amp;rsquo;italiana” system of landscaping. This fashion, widely employed in many outstanding examples of Renaissance gardens, is still in use nowadays. The presence of well cut green hedges bordering those ancient flowerbeds was a must and it is a sure fact that they existed here, but we know very little about the rest. For instance, what, if anything, could have been set in their central part? Prof. Jashemski found pollen, seeds, roots of flowering bushes and of some trees in her Pompeian gardens, but here at Villa Adriana nothing was left in the ground. We are bound to follow our imagination. Of course there could have been grass in the center of the flowerbeds as well as masses of blossoms. If the latter was the case - but, looking to “all&amp;rsquo;italiana” gardens, which are basically green gardens, I highly doubt it - the flowers should have been the kinds which were in fashion in ancient Roman times. In his Natural History (nat. 21.10), Pliny the Older explained that Romans didn&amp;rsquo;t use many of them. In their gardens they mainly planted roses and violets. However we must keep in mind that, for Pliny, the word violets meant every kind of small herbaceous species that could produce colored blossoms. He catalogued many kinds of them as the yellow, the purple, and the white kind, and it is highly probable that they must have been pimpernels as well as hyacinths and, of course real violets too. It is, however, evident that any of these plants could create gay clusters of blossoms in the center of a flowerbed and that they could make a very appealing garden.
c – The third garden of the Great Entrance Hall occupies its extreme western part (REICHARDT 1933, pp. 129-130). Here an unpaved courtyard circled a small temple, probably dedicated to the Imperial Lares (Fig. 9, L). The flowerbeds have still to be excavated, but, as in all the Great Entrance Hall&amp;rsquo;s area the tufa is practically surfacing, this must happen also here. Therefore it is highly probable that an excavation will bring to light the flowerbeds cut in the rock for the plants.

Africa proconsularis (Pleiades)
Province Description The history of Roman Africa begins in 146 BC with the destruction of Carthage and the establishment of the province of Africa in the most fertile part of the Carthaginian Empire. The new province covered about 5000 square miles (17,172 square kilometers) of the northern part of modern Tunisia. A praetor governed the area from his headquarters at Utica. The Romans inherited a thriving agriculture developed by the Carthaginians. The climate was hospitable. Wheat and barley were the most important cereals; wine and olive oil were also produced and there were various fruit trees.
Location THUGGA (Douga) Tunisia

Location Description Annexed in 46 B.C., the Romanization of the city of Thugga that was probably a residence of the Numidian kings, was gradual but profound. It became Municipium Thuggense in 205, and was raised to the rank of a Colonia Licinia Septima Aurelia Alexandriana Thuggensesin in 261 under Gallien. Numerous buildings of this city overlooking the valley of the Ouadi Khaled, have been uncovered among them the Capitol dedicated to the Capitoline Triad in 166-67, the theater on the top of the plateau constructed under Antonius Pius, the Temple of Mercury, Fortune, Augustan Piety, Liber Pater, Concordia, Frugifer, Pluto, Saturn and the Temple of Caelestis which stands in the middle of a an olive grove. In the residential areas stands the Licinian Baths with their Palestrae and the Cyclops Baths and the Triumphal Arch of Septimus Severus set astride a street leading down the hill. Two building inscriptions (CIL VIII, 26606 and CIL VIII, 26607), dated to AD 166-169 mention a theater with a basilica, porticoes, and xystis.
